onechapter it was a bright cold day in april and the clocks were striking thirteenwinston smith his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape thevile wind slipped quickly through the glass doors of victory mansionsthough not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from enteringalong with himthe hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats at one end of it acoloured poster too large for indoor display had been tacked to the wallit depicted simply an enormous face more than a metre wide the face of aman of about fortyfive with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsomefeatures winston made for the stairs it was no use trying the lift evenat the best of times it was seldom working and at present the electriccurrent was cut off during daylight hours it was part of the economy drivein preparation for hate week the flat was seven flights up and winstonwho was thirtynine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle wentslowly resting several times on the way on each landing opposite theliftshaft the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall it wasone of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you aboutwhen you move big brother is watching you the caption beneath it raninside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which hadsomething to do with the production of pigiron the voice came from anoblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surfaceof the righthand wall winston turned a switch and the voice sanksomewhat though the words were still distinguishable the instrumentthe telescreen it was called could be dimmed but there was no way ofshutting it off completely he moved over to the window a smallish frailfigure the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overallswhich were the uniform of the party his hair was very fair his facenaturally sanguine his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razorblades and the cold of the winter that had just endedoutside even through the shut windowpane the world looked cold down inthe street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper intospirals and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue thereseemed to be no colour in anything except the posters that were plasteredeverywhere the blackmoustachiod face gazed down from every commandingcorner there was one on the housefront immediately opposite big brotheris watching you the caption said while the dark eyes looked deep intowinstons own down at street level another poster torn at one cornerflapped fitfully in the wind alternately covering and uncovering thesingle word ingsoc in the far distance a helicopter skimmed down betweenthe roofs hovered for an instant like a bluebottle and darted away againwith a curving flight it was the police patrol snooping into peopleswindows the patrols did not matter however only the thought policematteredbehind winstons back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling awayabout pigiron and the overfulfilment of the ninth threeyear plan thetelescreen received and transmitted simultaneously any sound that winstonmade above the level of a very low whisper would be picked up by itmoreover so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metalplaque commanded he could be seen as well as heard there was of courseno way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment howoften or on what system the thought police plugged in on any individualwire was guesswork it was even conceivable that they watched everybody allthe time but at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wantedto you had to livedid live from habit that became instinctin theassumption that every sound you made was overheard and except indarkness every movement scrutinizedwinston kept his back turned to the telescreen it was safer though as hewell knew even a back can be revealing a kilometre away the ministry oftruth his place of work towered vast and white above the grimy landscapethis he thought with a sort of vague distastethis was london chiefcity of airstrip one itself the third most populous of the provinces ofoceania he tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell himwhether london had always been quite like this were there always thesevistas of rotting nineteenthcentury houses their sides shored up withbaulks of timber their windows patched with cardboard and their roofswith corrugated iron their crazy garden walls sagging in all directionsand the bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the air and thewillowherb straggled over the heaps of rubble and the places where thebombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung up sordid coloniesof wooden dwellings like chickenhouses but it was no use he could notremember nothing remained of his childhood except a series of brightlittableaux occurring against no background and mostly unintelligiblethe ministry of truthminitrue in newspeak newspeak was the officiallanguage of oceania for an account of its structure and etymology seeappendixwas startlingly different from any other object in sight itwas an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete soaringup terrace after terrace  metres into the air from where winstonstood it was just possible to read picked out on its white face inelegant lettering the three slogans of the party  war is peace  freedom is slavery  ignorance is strengththe ministry of truth contained it was said three thousand rooms aboveground level and corresponding ramifications below scattered about londonthere were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size socompletely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roofof victory mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously theywere the homes of the four ministries between which the entire apparatusof government was divided the ministry of truth which concerned itselfwith news entertainment education and the fine arts the ministry ofpeace which concerned itself with war the ministry of love whichmaintained law and order and the ministry of plenty which was responsiblefor economic affairs their names in newspeak minitrue minipax miniluvand miniplentythe ministry of love was the really frightening one there were no windowsin it at all winston had never been inside the ministry of love norwithin half a kilometre of it it was a place impossible to enter excepton official business and then only by penetrating through a maze ofbarbedwire entanglements steel doors and hidden machinegun nests eventhe streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorillafacedguards in black uniforms armed with jointed truncheonswinston turned round abruptly he had set his features into theexpression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facingthe telescreen he crossed the room into the tiny kitchen by leavingthe ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in thecanteen and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen excepta hunk of darkcoloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrowsbreakfast he took down from the shelf a bottle of colourless liquidwith a plain white label marked victory gin it gave off a sickly oilysmell as of chinese ricespirit winston poured out nearly a teacupfulnerved himself for a shock and gulped it down like a dose of medicineinstantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes thestuff was like nitric acid and moreover in swallowing it one had thesensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club thenext moment however the burning in his belly died down and the worldbegan to look more cheerful he took a cigarette from a crumpled packetmarked victory cigarettes and incautiously held it upright whereupon thetobacco fell out on to the floor with the next he was more successfulhe went back to the livingroom and sat down at a small table that stoodto the left of the telescreen from the table drawer he took out apenholder a bottle of ink and a thick quartosized blank book with ared back and a marbled coverfor some reason the telescreen in the livingroom was in an unusualposition instead of being placed as was normal in the end wall whereit could command the whole room it was in the longer wall opposite thewindow to one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which winstonwas now sitting and which when the flats were built had probably beenintended to hold bookshelves by sitting in the alcove and keeping wellback winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen sofar as sight went he could be heard of course but so long as he stayedin his present position he could not be seen it was partly the unusualgeography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was nowabout to dobut it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out ofthe drawer it was a peculiarly beautiful book its smooth creamy papera little yellowed by age was of a kind that had not been manufactured forat least forty years past he could guess however that the book was mucholder than that he had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy littlejunkshop in a slummy quarter of the town just what quarter he did notnow remember and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desireto possess it party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shopsdealing on the free market it was called but the rule was notstrictly kept because there were various things such as shoelaces andrazor blades which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way hehad given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped insideand bought the book for two dollars fifty at the time he was not consciousof wanting it for any particular purpose he had carried it guiltily homein his briefcase even with nothing written in it it was a compromisingpossessionthe thing that he was about to do was to open a diary this was not illegalnothing was illegal since there were no longer any laws but if detectedit was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death or at leastby twentyfive years in a forcedlabour camp winston fitted a nib intothe penholder and sucked it to get the grease off the pen was an archaicinstrument seldom used even for signatures and he had procured onefurtively and with some difficulty simply because of a feeling that thebeautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on with a real nib insteadof being scratched with an inkpencil actually he was not used to writingby hand apart from very short notes it was usual to dictate everythinginto the speakwrite which was of course impossible for his presentpurpose he dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just asecond a tremor had gone through his bowels to mark the paper was thedecisive act in small clumsy letters he wrote   april th he sat back a sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him tobegin with he did not know with any certainty that this was  itmust be round about that date since he was fairly sure that his age wasthirtynine and he believed that he had been born in  or  butit was never possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or twofor whom it suddenly occurred to him to wonder was he writing this diaryfor the future for the unborn his mind hovered for a moment round thedoubtful date on the page and then fetched up with a bump against thenewspeak word doublethink for the first time the magnitude of what he hadundertaken came home to him how could you communicate with the future itwas of its nature impossible either the future would resemble the presentin which case it would not listen to him or it would be different from itand his predicament would be meaninglessfor some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper the telescreen hadchanged over to strident military music it was curious that he seemednot merely to have lost the power of expressing himself but even to haveforgotten what it was that he had originally intended to say for weekspast he had been making ready for this moment and it had never crossedhis mind that anything would be needed except courage the actual writingwould be easy all he had to do was to transfer to paper the interminablerestless monologue that had been running inside his head literally foryears at this moment however even the monologue had dried up moreoverhis varicose ulcer had begun itching unbearably he dared not scratch itbecause if he did so it always became inflamed the seconds were tickingby he was conscious of nothing except the blankness of the page in frontof him the itching of the skin above his ankle the blaring of the musicand a slight booziness caused by the ginsuddenly he began writing in sheer panic only imperfectly aware of whathe was setting down his small but childish handwriting straggled up anddown the page shedding first its capital letters and finally even itsfull stops   april th  last night to the flicks all war films one very goodone of a ship full of refugees being bombed somewhere in the mediterraneanaudience much amused by shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim awaywith a helicopter after him first you saw him wallowing along in thewater like a porpoise then you saw him through the helicopters gunsightsthen he was full of holes and the sea round him turned pink and he sank assuddenly as though the holes had let in the water audience shouting withlaughter when he sank then you saw a lifeboat full of children with ahelicopter hovering over it there was a middleaged woman might have beena jewess sitting up in the bow with a little boy about three years old inher arms little boy screaming with fright and hiding his head between herbreasts as if he was trying to burrow right into her and the woman puttingher arms round him and comforting him although she was blue with frightherself all the time covering him up as much as possible as if she thoughther arms could keep the bullets off him then the helicopter planted a kilo bomb in among them terrific flash and the boat went all to matchwoodthen there was a wonderful shot of a childs arm going up up up right upinto the air a helicopter with a camera in its nose must have followed itup and there was a lot of applause from the party seats but a woman down inthe prole part of the house suddenly started kicking up a fuss and shoutingthey didnt oughter of showed it not in front of kids they didnt it aintright not in front of kids it aint until the police turned her turned herout i dont suppose anything happened to her nobody cares what the prolessay typical prole reaction they neverwinston stopped writing partly because he was suffering from cramp he didnot know what had made him pour out this stream of rubbish but the curiousthing was that while he was doing so a totally different memory hadclarified itself in his mind to the point where he almost felt equal towriting it down it was he now realized because of this other incidentthat he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary todayit had happened that morning at the ministry if anything so nebulous couldbe said to happenit was nearly eleven hundred and in the records department where winstonworked they were dragging the chairs out of the cubicles and grouping themin the centre of the hall opposite the big telescreen in preparation forthe two minutes hate winston was just taking his place in one of themiddle rows when two people whom he knew by sight but had never spokento came unexpectedly into the room one of them was a girl whom he oftenpassed in the corridors he did not know her name but he knew that sheworked in the fiction department presumablysince he had sometimes seenher with oily hands and carrying a spannershe had some mechanical jobon one of the novelwriting machines she was a boldlooking girl ofabout twentyseven with thick hair a freckled face and swift athleticmovements a narrow scarlet sash emblem of the junior antisex league waswound several times round the waist of her overalls just tightly enough tobring out the shapeliness of her hips winston had disliked her from thevery first moment of seeing her he knew the reason it was because of theatmosphere of hockeyfields and cold baths and community hikes and generalcleanmindedness which she managed to carry about with her he dislikednearly all women and especially the young and pretty ones it was alwaysthe women and above all the young ones who were the most bigotedadherents of the party the swallowers of slogans the amateur spies andnosersout of unorthodoxy but this particular girl gave him the impressionof being more dangerous than most once when they passed in the corridorshe gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right intohim and for a moment had filled him with black terror the idea had evencrossed his mind that she might be an agent of the thought police thatit was true was very unlikely still he continued to feel a peculiaruneasiness which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility whenevershe was anywhere near himthe other person was a man named obrien a member of the inner party andholder of some post so important and remote that winston had only a dimidea of its nature a momentary hush passed over the group of peopleround the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an inner party memberapproaching obrien was a large burly man with a thick neck and a coarsehumorous brutal face in spite of his formidable appearance he had acertain charm of manner he had a trick of resettling his spectacles onhis nose which was curiously disarmingin some indefinable way curiouslycivilized it was a gesture which if anyone had still thought in suchterms might have recalled an eighteenthcentury nobleman offering hissnuffbox winston had seen obrien perhaps a dozen times in almost as manyyears he felt deeply drawn to him and not solely because he was intriguedby the contrast between obriens urbane manner and his prizefightersphysique much more it was because of a secretly held beliefor perhapsnot even a belief merely a hopethat obriens political orthodoxy wasnot perfect something in his face suggested it irresistibly and againperhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face butsimply intelligence but at any rate he had the appearance of being aperson that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen andget him alone winston had never made the smallest effort to verify thisguess indeed there was no way of doing so at this moment obrien glancedat his wristwatch saw that it was nearly eleven hundred and evidentlydecided to stay in the records department until the two minutes hate wasover he took a chair in the same row as winston a couple of places awaya small sandyhaired woman who worked in the next cubicle to winston wasbetween them the girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behindthe next moment a hideous grinding speech as of some monstrous machinerunning without oil burst from the big telescreen at the end of the roomit was a noise that set ones teeth on edge and bristled the hair at theback of ones neck the hate had startedas usual the face of emmanuel goldstein the enemy of the people hadflashed on to the screen there were hisses here and there among theaudience the little sandyhaired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear anddisgust goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once long agohow long ago nobody quite remembered had been one of the leadingfigures of the party almost on a level with big brother himself andthen had engaged in counterrevolutionary activities had been condemnedto death and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared the programmesof the two minutes hate varied from day to day but there was none inwhich goldstein was not the principal figure he was the primal traitorthe earliest defiler of the partys purity all subsequent crimes againstthe party all treacheries acts of sabotage heresies deviationssprang directly out of his teaching somewhere or other he was stillalive and hatching his conspiracies perhaps somewhere beyond the seaunder the protection of his foreign paymasters perhaps evenso it wasoccasionally rumouredin some hidingplace in oceania itselfwinstons diaphragm was constricted he could never see the face ofgoldstein without a painful mixture of emotions it was a lean jewish facewith a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee beardaclever face and yet somehow inherently despicable with a kind of senilesilliness in the long thin nose near the end of which a pair of spectacleswas perched it resembled the face of a sheep and the voice too had asheeplike quality goldstein was delivering his usual venomous attackupon the doctrines of the partyan attack so exaggerated and perverse thata child should have been able to see through it and yet just plausibleenough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people lesslevelheaded than oneself might be taken in by it he was abusing bigbrother he was denouncing the dictatorship of the party he was demandingthe immediate conclusion of peace with eurasia he was advocating freedomof speech freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of thoughthe was crying hysterically that the revolution had been betrayedand allthis in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of thehabitual style of the orators of the party and even contained newspeakwords more newspeak words indeed than any party member would normallyuse in real life and all the while lest one should be in any doubt as tothe reality which goldsteins specious claptrap covered behind his head onthe telescreen there marched the endless columns of the eurasian armyrowafter row of solidlooking men with expressionless asiatic faces who swamup to the surface of the screen and vanished to be replaced by othersexactly similar the dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers boots formed thebackground to goldsteins bleating voicebefore the hate had proceeded for thirty seconds uncontrollableexclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the roomthe selfsatisfied sheeplike face on the screen and the terrifying powerof the eurasian army behind it were too much to be borne besidesthe sight or even the thought of goldstein produced fear and angerautomatically he was an object of hatred more constant than either eurasiaor eastasia since when oceania was at war with one of these powers it wasgenerally at peace with the other but what was strange was that althoughgoldstein was hated and despised by everybody although every day and athousand times a day on platforms on the telescreen in newspapersin books his theories were refuted smashed ridiculed held up to thegeneral gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they werein spite of all thishis influence never seemed to grow less always there were fresh dupeswaiting to be seduced by him a day never passed when spies and saboteursacting under his directions were not unmasked by the thought policehe was the commander of a vast shadowy army an underground network ofconspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the state the brotherhood itsname was supposed to be there were also whispered stories of a terriblebook a compendium of all the heresies of which goldstein was the authorand which circulated clandestinely here and there it was a book without atitle people referred to it if at all simply as the book but one knewof such things only through vague rumours neither the brotherhood northe book was a subject that any ordinary party member would mention ifthere was a way of avoiding itin its second minute the hate rose to a frenzy people were leaping up anddown in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an effortto drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen the littlesandyhaired woman had turned bright pink and her mouth was opening andshutting like that of a landed fish even obriens heavy face was flushedhe was sitting very straight in his chair his powerful chest swelling andquivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave thedarkhaired girl behind winston had begun crying out swine swine swineand suddenly she picked up a heavy newspeak dictionary and flung it at thescreen it struck goldsteins nose and bounced off the voice continuedinexorably in a lucid moment winston found that he was shouting with theothers and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair thehorrible thing about the two minutes hate was not that one was obliged toact a part but on the contrary that it was impossible to avoid joiningin within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary a hideousecstasy of fear and vindictiveness a desire to kill to torture to smashfaces in with a sledgehammer seemed to flow through the whole group ofpeople like an electric current turning one even against ones will intoa grimacing screaming lunatic and yet the rage that one felt was anabstract undirected emotion which could be switched from one object toanother like the flame of a blowlamp thus at one moment winstons hatredwas not turned against goldstein at all but on the contrary againstbig brother the party and the thought police and at such moments hisheart went out to the lonely derided heretic on the screen sole guardianof truth and sanity in a world of lies and yet the very next instant hewas at one with the people about him and all that was said of goldsteinseemed to him to be true at those moments his secret loathing of bigbrother changed into adoration and big brother seemed to tower up aninvincible fearless protector standing like a rock against the hordesof asia and goldstein in spite of his isolation his helplessness andthe doubt that hung about his very existence seemed like some sinisterenchanter capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structureof civilizationit was even possible at moments to switch ones hatred this way or thatby a voluntary act suddenly by the sort of violent effort with which onewrenches ones head away from the pillow in a nightmare winston succeededin transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the darkhairedgirl behind him vivid beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mindhe would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon he would tie her nakedto a stake and shoot her full of arrows like saint sebastian he wouldravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax better than beforemoreover he realized why it was that he hated her he hated her becauseshe was young and pretty and sexless because he wanted to go to bed withher and would never do so because round her sweet supple waist whichseemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm there was only the odiousscarlet sash aggressive symbol of chastitythe hate rose to its climax the voice of goldstein had become an actualsheeps bleat and for an instant the face changed into that of a sheepthen the sheepface melted into the figure of a eurasian soldier who seemedto be advancing huge and terrible his submachine gun roaring andseeming to spring out of the surface of the screen so that some of thepeople in the front row actually flinched backwards in their seats butin the same moment drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody thehostile figure melted into the face of big brother blackhairedblackmoustachiod full of power and mysterious calm and so vast thatit almost filled up the screen nobody heard what big brother was sayingit was merely a few words of encouragement the sort of words that areuttered in the din of battle not distinguishable individually butrestoring confidence by the fact of being spoken then the face of bigbrother faded away again and instead the three slogans of the party stoodout in bold capitals  war is peace  freedom is slavery  ignorance is strengthbut the face of big brother seemed to persist for several seconds on thescreen as though the impact that it had made on everyones eyeballs wastoo vivid to wear off immediately the little sandyhaired woman had flungherself forward over the back of the chair in front of her with atremulous murmur that sounded like my saviour she extended her armstowards the screen then she buried her face in her hands it was apparentthat she was uttering a prayerat this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep slowrhythmical chant of bbbbover and over again very slowly with along pause between the first b and the seconda heavy murmurous soundsomehow curiously savage in the background of which one seemed to hear thestamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tomtoms for perhaps as much asthirty seconds they kept it up it was a refrain that was often heard inmoments of overwhelming emotion partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdomand majesty of big brother but still more it was an act of selfhypnosisa deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noisewinstons entrails seemed to grow cold in the two minutes hate he couldnot help sharing in the general delirium but this subhuman chanting ofbbbb always filled him with horror of course he chanted with therest it was impossible to do otherwise to dissemble your feelings tocontrol your face to do what everyone else was doing was an instinctivereaction but there was a space of a couple of seconds during which theexpression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him and it wasexactly at this moment that the significant thing happenedif indeedit did happenmomentarily he caught obriens eye obrien had stood up he had takenoff his spectacles and was in the act of resettling them on his nose withhis characteristic gesture but there was a fraction of a second whentheir eyes met and for as long as it took to happen winston knewyes heknewthat obrien was thinking the same thing as himself an unmistakablemessage had passed it was as though their two minds had opened and thethoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes i amwith you obrien seemed to be saying to him i know precisely what youare feeling i know all about your contempt your hatred your disgustbut dont worry i am on your side and then the flash of intelligencewas gone and obriens face was as inscrutable as everybody elsesthat was all and he was already uncertain whether it had happened suchincidents never had any sequel all that they did was to keep alive in himthe belief or hope that others besides himself were the enemies of theparty perhaps the rumours of vast underground conspiracies were true afterallperhaps the brotherhood really existed it was impossible in spiteof the endless arrests and confessions and executions to be sure that thebrotherhood was not simply a myth some days he believed in it some daysnot there was no evidence only fleeting glimpses that might mean anythingor nothing snatches of overheard conversation faint scribbles on lavatorywallsonce even when two strangers met a small movement of the handwhich had looked as though it might be a signal of recognition it was allguesswork very likely he had imagined everything he had gone back to hiscubicle without looking at obrien again the idea of following up theirmomentary contact hardly crossed his mind it would have been inconceivablydangerous even if he had known how to set about doing it for a second twoseconds they had exchanged an equivocal glance and that was the end ofthe story but even that was a memorable event in the locked loneliness inwhich one had to livewinston roused himself and sat up straighter he let out a belch the ginwas rising from his stomachhis eyes refocused on the page he discovered that while he sat helplesslymusing he had also been writing as though by automatic action and it wasno longer the same cramped awkward handwriting as before his pen had slidvoluptuously over the smooth paper printing in large neat capitals  down with big brother  down with big brother  down with big brother  down with big brother  down with big brotherover and over again filling half a pagehe could not help feeling a twinge of panic it was absurd since thewriting of those particular words was not more dangerous than the initialact of opening the diary but for a moment he was tempted to tear out thespoiled pages and abandon the enterprise altogetherhe did not do so however because he knew that it was useless whether hewrote down with big brother or whether he refrained from writing it madeno difference whether he went on with the diary or whether he did not goon with it made no difference the thought police would get him just thesame he had committedwould still have committed even if he had neverset pen to paperthe essential crime that contained all others in itselfthoughtcrime they called it thoughtcrime was not a thing that could beconcealed for ever you might dodge successfully for a while even foryears but sooner or later they were bound to get youit was always at nightthe arrests invariably happened at night thesudden jerk out of sleep the rough hand shaking your shoulder the lightsglaring in your eyes the ring of hard faces round the bed in the vastmajority of cases there was no trial no report of the arrest peoplesimply disappeared always during the night your name was removed from theregisters every record of everything you had ever done was wiped out youronetime existence was denied and then forgotten you were abolishedannihilated vaporized was the usual wordfor a moment he was seized by a kind of hysteria he began writing in ahurried untidy scrawl   theyll shoot me i dont care theyll shoot me in the back of the neck idont care down with big brother they always shoot you in the back of theneck i dont care down with big brotherhe sat back in his chair slightly ashamed of himself and laid downthe pen the next moment he started violently there was a knocking atthe dooralready he sat as still as a mouse in the futile hope that whoever it wasmight go away after a single attempt but no the knocking was repeatedthe worst thing of all would be to delay his heart was thumping like adrum but his face from long habit was probably expressionless he gotup and moved heavily towards the doorchapter as he put his hand to the doorknob winston saw that he had left thediary open on the table down with big brother was written all over itin letters almost big enough to be legible across the room it was aninconceivably stupid thing to have done but he realized even in hispanic he had not wanted to smudge the creamy paper by shutting the bookwhile the ink was wethe drew in his breath and opened the door instantly a warm wave of reliefflowed through him a colourless crushedlooking woman with wispy hairand a lined face was standing outsideoh comrade she began in a dreary whining sort of voice i thought iheard you come in do you think you could come across and have a look atour kitchen sink its got blocked up andit was mrs parsons the wife of a neighbour on the same floor mrs wasa word somewhat discountenanced by the partyyou were supposed to calleveryone comradebut with some women one used it instinctively she wasa woman of about thirty but looking much older one had the impressionthat there was dust in the creases of her face winston followed her downthe passage these amateur repair jobs were an almost daily irritationvictory mansions were old flats built in  or thereabouts and werefalling to pieces the plaster flaked constantly from ceilings and wallsthe pipes burst in every hard frost the roof leaked whenever there wassnow the heating system was usually running at half steam when it was notclosed down altogether from motives of economy repairs except what youcould do for yourself had to be sanctioned by remote committees whichwere liable to hold up even the mending of a windowpane for two yearsof course its only because tom isnt home said mrs parsons vaguelythe parsons flat was bigger than winstons and dingy in a differentway everything had a battered trampledon look as though theplace had just been visited by some large violent animal gamesimpedimentahockeysticks boxinggloves a burst football a pair ofsweaty shorts turned inside outlay all over the floor and on thetable there was a litter of dirty dishes and dogeared exercisebookson the walls were scarlet banners of the youth league and the spies anda fullsized poster of big brother there was the usual boiledcabbagesmell common to the whole building but it was shot through by a sharperreek of sweat whichone knew this at the first sniff though it washard to say howwas the sweat of some person not present at the momentin another room someone with a comb and a piece of toilet paper wastrying to keep tune with the military music which was still issuingfrom the telescreenits the children said mrs parsons casting a halfapprehensive glanceat the door they havent been out today and of courseshe had a habit of breaking off her sentences in the middle the kitchensink was full nearly to the brim with filthy greenish water which smeltworse than ever of cabbage winston knelt down and examined the anglejointof the pipe he hated using his hands and he hated bending down which wasalways liable to start him coughing mrs parsons looked on helplesslyof course if tom was home hed put it right in a moment she saidhe loves anything like that hes ever so good with his hands tom isparsons was winstons fellowemployee at the ministry of truth he wasa fattish but active man of paralysing stupidity a mass of imbecileenthusiasmsone of those completely unquestioning devoted drudges onwhom more even than on the thought police the stability of the partydepended at thirtyfive he had just been unwillingly evicted from theyouth league and before graduating into the youth league he had managed tostay on in the spies for a year beyond the statutory age at the ministryhe was employed in some subordinate post for which intelligence was notrequired but on the other hand he was a leading figure on the sportscommittee and

pipe that he had put in an appearance at the community centre everyevening for the past four years an overpowering smell of sweat a sort ofunconscious testimony to the strenuousness of his life followed him aboutwherever he went and even remained behind him after he had gonehave you got a spanner said winston fiddling with the nut on theanglejointa spanner said mrs parsons immediately becoming invertebrate i dontknow im sure perhaps the childrenthere was a trampling of boots and another blast on the comb as thechildren charged into the livingroom mrs parsons brought the spannerwinston let out the water and disgustedly removed the clot of human hairthat had blocked up the pipe he cleaned his fingers as best he could inthe cold water from the tap and went back into the other roomup with your hands yelled a savage voicea handsome toughlooking boy of nine had popped up from behind the tableand was menacing him with a toy automatic pistol while his small sisterabout two years younger made the same gesture with a fragment of woodboth of them were dressed in the blue shorts grey shirts and redneckerchiefs which were the uniform of the spies winston raised his handsabove his head but with an uneasy feeling so vicious was the boysdemeanour that it was not altogether a gameyoure a traitor yelled the boy youre a thoughtcriminal youre aeurasian spy ill shoot you ill vaporize you ill send you to the saltminessuddenly they were both leaping round him shouting traitor andthoughtcriminal the little girl imitating her brother in everymovement it was somehow slightly frightening like the gambolling oftiger cubs which will soon grow up into maneaters there was a sort ofcalculating ferocity in the boys eye a quite evident desire to hit orkick winston and a consciousness of being very nearly big enough to do soit was a good job it was not a real pistol he was holding winston thoughtmrs parsons eyes flitted nervously from winston to the children and backagain in the better light of the livingroom he noticed with interestthat there actually was dust in the creases of her facethey do get so noisy she said theyre disappointed because theycouldnt go to see the hanging thats what it is im too busy to takethem and tom wont be back from work in timewhy cant we go and see the hanging roared the boy in his huge voicewant to see the hanging want to see the hanging chanted the littlegirl still capering roundsome eurasian prisoners guilty of war crimes were to be hanged in thepark that evening winston remembered this happened about once a monthand was a popular spectacle children always clamoured to be taken to seeit he took his leave of mrs parsons and made for the door but he had notgone six steps down the passage when something hit the back of his neck anagonizingly painful blow it was as though a redhot wire had been jabbedinto him he spun round just in time to see mrs parsons dragging her sonback into the doorway while the boy pocketed a catapultgoldstein bellowed the boy as the door closed on him but what moststruck winston was the look of helpless fright on the womans greyish faceback in the flat he stepped quickly past the telescreen and sat down at thetable again still rubbing his neck the music from the telescreen hadstopped instead a clipped military voice was reading out with a sort ofbrutal relish a description of the armaments of the new floating fortresswhich had just been anchored between iceland and the faroe islandswith those children he thought that wretched woman must lead a life ofterror another year two years and they would be watching her nightand day for symptoms of unorthodoxy nearly all children nowadays werehorrible what was worst of all was that by means of such organizations asthe spies they were systematically turned into ungovernable little savagesand yet this produced in them no tendency whatever to rebel against thediscipline of the party on the contrary they adored the party andeverything connected with it the songs the processions the banners thehiking the drilling with dummy rifles the yelling of slogans the worshipof big brotherit was all a sort of glorious game to them all theirferocity was turned outwards against the enemies of the state againstforeigners traitors saboteurs thoughtcriminals it was almost normalfor people over thirty to be frightened of their own children and withgood reason for hardly a week passed in which the times did not carrya paragraph describing how some eavesdropping little sneakchild herowas the phrase generally usedhad overheard some compromising remarkand denounced its parents to the thought policethe sting of the catapult bullet had worn off he picked up his penhalfheartedly wondering whether he could find something more to writein the diary suddenly he began thinking of obrien againyears agohow long was it seven years it must behe had dreamed that hewas walking through a pitchdark room and someone sitting to one side ofhim had said as he passed we shall meet in the place where there is nodarkness it was said very quietly almost casuallya statement not acommand he had walked on without pausing what was curious was that at thetime in the dream the words had not made much impression on him it wasonly later and by degrees that they had seemed to take on significance hecould not now remember whether it was before or after having the dream thathe had seen obrien for the first time nor could he remember when he hadfirst identified the voice as obriens but at any rate the identificationexisted it was obrien who had spoken to him out of the darkwinston had never been able to feel sureeven after this mornings flashof the eyes it was still impossible to be sure whether obrien was a friendor an enemy nor did it even seem to matter greatly there was a link ofunderstanding between them more important than affection or partisanshipwe shall meet in the place where there is no darkness he had saidwinston did not know what it meant only that in some way or another itwould come truethe voice from the telescreen paused a trumpet call clear and beautifulfloated into the stagnant air the voice continued

might startwondering why he had been writing during the lunch interval why he hadused an oldfashioned pen what he had been writingand then drop a hintin the appropriate quarter he went to the bathroom and carefully scrubbedthe ink away with the gritty darkbrown soap which rasped your skin likesandpaper and was therefore well adapted for this purposehe put the diary away in the drawer it was quite useless to think ofhiding it but he could at least make sure whether or not its existence hadbeen discovered a hair laid across the pageends was too obvious with thetip of his finger he picked up an identifiable grain of whitish dust anddeposited it on the corner of the cover where it was bound to be shakenoff if the book was movedchapter winston was dreaming of his motherhe must he thought have been ten or eleven years old when his mother haddisappeared she was a tall statuesque rather silent woman with slowmovements and magnificent fair hair his father he remembered more vaguelyas dark and thin dressed always in neat dark clothes winston rememberedespecially the very thin soles of his fathers shoes and wearingspectacles the two of them must evidently have been swallowed up in oneof the first great purges of the fiftiesat this moment his mother was sitting in some place deep down beneath himwith his young sister in her arms he did not remember his sister at allexcept as a tiny feeble baby always silent with large watchful eyesboth of them were looking up at him they were down in some subterraneanplacethe bottom of a well for instance or a very deep gravebut itwas a place which already far below him was itself moving downwardsthey were in the saloon of a sinking ship looking up at him through thedarkening water there was still air in the saloon they could still seehim and he them but all the while they were sinking down down into thegreen waters which in another moment must hide them from sight for everhe was out in the light and air while they were being sucked down to deathand they were down there because he was up here he knew it and they knewit and he could see the knowledge in their faces there was no reproacheither in their faces or in their hearts only the knowledge that theymust die in order that he might remain alive and that this was part ofthe unavoidable order of thingshe could not remember what had happened but he knew in his dream that insome way the lives of his mother and his sister had been sacrificed to hisown it was one of those dreams which while retaining the characteristicdream scenery are a continuation of ones intellectual life and in whichone becomes aware of facts and ideas which still seem new and valuableafter one is awake the thing that now suddenly struck winston was that hismothers death nearly thirty years ago had been tragic and sorrowful ina way that was no longer possible tragedy he perceived belonged to theancient time to a time when there was still privacy love and friendshipand when the members of a family stood by one another without needing toknow the reason his mothers memory tore at his heart because she had diedloving him when he was too young and selfish to love her in return andbecause somehow he did not remember how she had sacrificed herself to aconception of loyalty that was private and unalterable such things hesaw could not happen today today there were fear hatred and pain butno dignity of emotion no deep or complex sorrows all this he seemed tosee in the large eyes of his mother and his sister looking up at himthrough the green water hundreds of fathoms down and still sinkingsuddenly he was standing on short springy turf on a summer evening whenthe slanting rays of the sun gilded the ground the landscape that he waslooking at recurred so often in his dreams that he was never fully certainwhether or not he had seen it in the real world in his waking thoughts hecalled it the golden country it was an old rabbitbitten pasture with afoottrack wandering across it and a molehill here and there in the raggedhedge on the opposite side of the field the boughs of the elm trees wereswaying very faintly in the breeze their leaves just stirring in densemasses like womens hair somewhere near at hand though out of sightthere was a clear slowmoving stream where dace were swimming in thepools under the willow treesthe girl with dark hair was coming towards them across the field withwhat seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung themdisdainfully aside her body was white and smooth but it aroused no desirein him indeed he barely looked at it what overwhelmed him in that instantwas admiration for the gesture with which she had thrown her clothes asidewith its grace and carelessness it seemed to annihilate a whole culturea whole system of thought as though big brother and the party and thethought police could all be swept into nothingness by a single splendidmovement of the arm that too was a gesture belonging to the ancient timewinston woke up with the word shakespeare on his lipsthe telescreen was giving forth an earsplitting whistle which continued onthe same note for thirty seconds it was nought seven fifteen gettinguptime for office workers winston wrenched his body out of bednaked fora member of the outer party received only  clothing coupons annuallyand a suit of pyjamas was and seized a dingy singlet and a pair ofshorts that were lying across a chair the physical jerks would begin inthree minutes the next moment he was doubled up by a violent coughing fitwhich nearly always attacked him soon after waking up it emptied his lungsso completely that he could only begin breathing again by lying on his backand taking a series of deep gasps his veins had swelled with the effort ofthe cough and the varicose ulcer had started itchingthirty to forty group yapped a piercing female voice thirty to fortygroup take your places please thirties to fortieswinston sprang to attention in front of the telescreen upon which theimage of a youngish woman scrawny but muscular dressed in tunic andgymshoes had already appearedarms bending and stretching she rapped out take your time by me onetwo three four one two three four come on comrades put a bit oflife into it one two three four one two three fourthe pain of the coughing fit had not quite driven out of winstons mind theimpression made by his dream and the rhythmic movements of the exerciserestored it somewhat as he mechanically shot his arms back and forthwearing on his face the look of grim enjoyment which was considered properduring the physical jerks he was struggling to think his way backward intothe dim period of his early childhood it was extraordinarily difficultbeyond the late fifties everything faded when there were no externalrecords that you could refer to even the outline of your own life lostits sharpness you remembered huge events which had quite probably nothappened you remembered the detail of incidents without being able torecapture their atmosphere and there were long blank periods to which youcould assign nothing everything had been different then even the names ofcountries and their shapes on the map had been different airstrip onefor instance had not been so called in those days it had been calledengland or britain though london he felt fairly certain had always beencalled londonwinston could not definitely remember a time when his country had not beenat war but it was evident that there had been a fairly long interval ofpeace during his childhood because one of his early memories was of an airraid which appeared to take everyone by surprise perhaps it was the timewhen the atomic bomb had fallen on colchester he did not remember the raiditself but he did remember his fathers hand clutching his own as theyhurried down down down into some place deep in the earth round and rounda spiral staircase which rang under his feet and which finally so weariedhis legs that he began whimpering and they had to stop and rest hismother in her slow dreamy way was following a long way behind them shewas carrying his baby sisteror perhaps it was only a bundle of blanketsthat she was carrying he was not certain whether his sister had been bornthen finally they had emerged into a noisy crowded place which he hadrealized to be a tube stationthere were people sitting all over the stoneflagged floor and otherpeople packed tightly together were sitting on metal bunks one abovethe other winston and his mother and father found themselves a place onthe floor and near them an old man and an old woman were sitting side byside on a bunk the old man had on a decent dark suit and a black cloth cappushed back from very white hair his face was scarlet and his eyes wereblue and full of tears he reeked of gin it seemed to breathe out of hisskin in place of sweat and one could have fancied that the tears wellingfrom his eyes were pure gin but though slightly drunk he was alsosuffering under some grief that was genuine and unbearable in his childishway winston grasped that some terrible thing something that was beyondforgiveness and could never be remedied had just happened it also seemedto him that he knew what it was someone whom the old man loveda littlegranddaughter perhapshad been killed every few minutes the old man keptrepeatingwe didnt ought to ave trusted em i said so ma didnt i thats whatcomes of trusting em i said so all along we didnt ought to ave trustedthe buggersbut which buggers they didnt ought to have trusted winston could not nowremembersince about that time war had been literally continuous though strictlyspeaking it had not always been the same war for several months during hischildhood there had been confused street fighting in london itself someof which he remembered vividly but to trace out the history of the wholeperiod to say who was fighting whom at any given moment would have beenutterly impossible since no written record and no spoken word ever mademention of any other alignment than the existing one at this moment forexample in  if it was  oceania was at war with eurasia andin alliance with eastasia in no public or private utterance was it everadmitted that the three powers had at any time been grouped along differentlines actually as winston well knew it was only four years since oceaniahad been at war with eastasia and in alliance with eurasia but that wasmerely a piece of furtive knowledge which he happened to possess becausehis memory was not satisfactorily under control officially the change ofpartners had never happened oceania was at war with eurasia thereforeoceania had always been at war with eurasia the enemy of the moment alwaysrepresented absolute evil and it followed that any past or futureagreement with him was impossiblethe frightening thing he reflected for the ten thousandth time as heforced his shoulders painfully backward with hands on hips they weregyrating their bodies from the waist an exercise that was supposed to begood for the back musclesthe frightening thing was that it might all betrue if the party could thrust its hand into the past and say of this orthat event it never happenedthat surely was more terrifying than meretorture and deaththe party said that oceania had never been in alliance with eurasia hewinston smith knew that oceania had been in alliance with eurasia as shorta time as four years ago but where did that knowledge exist only in hisown consciousness which in any case must soon be annihilated and if allothers accepted the lie which the party imposedif all records told thesame talethen the lie passed into history and became truth who controlsthe past ran the party slogan controls the future who controls thepresent controls the past and yet the past though of its naturealterable never had been altered whatever was true now was true fromeverlasting to everlasting it was quite simple all that was needed wasan unending series of victories over your own memory reality controlthey called it in newspeak doublethinkstand easy barked the instructress a little more geniallywinston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilled his lungs with airhis mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink to knowand not to know to be conscious of complete truthfulness while tellingcarefully constructed lies to hold simultaneously two opinions whichcancelled out knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both ofthem to use logic against logic to repudiate morality while laying claimto it to believe that democracy was impossible and that the party was theguardian of democracy to forget whatever it was necessary to forget thento draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed andthen promptly to forget it again and above all to apply the same processto the process itself that was the ultimate subtlety consciously toinduce unconsciousness and then once again to become unconscious ofthe act of hypnosis you had just performed even to understand the worddoublethink involved the use of doublethinkthe instructress had called them to attention again and now lets seewhich of us can touch our toes she said enthusiastically right overfrom the hips please comrades onetwo onetwowinston loathed this exercise which sent shooting pains all the way fromhis heels to his buttocks and often ended by bringing on another coughingfit the halfpleasant quality went out of his meditations the past hereflected had not merely been altered it had been actually destroyed forhow could you establish even the most obvious fact when there existed norecord outside your own memory he tried to remember in what year he hadfirst heard mention of big brother he thought it must have been at sometime in the sixties but it was impossible to be certain in the partyhistories of course big brother figured as the leader and guardian of therevolution since its very earliest days his exploits had been graduallypushed backwards in time until already they extended into the fabulousworld of the forties and the thirties when the capitalists in theirstrange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of london in greatgleaming motorcars or horse carriages with glass sides there was noknowing how much of this legend was true and how much invented winstoncould not even remember at what date the party itself had come intoexistence he did not believe he had ever heard the word ingsoc before but it was possible that in its oldspeak formenglish socialismthat is to sayit had been current earlier everything melted into mistsometimes indeed you could put your finger on a definite lie it was nottrue for example as was claimed in the party history books that theparty had invented aeroplanes he remembered aeroplanes since his earliestchildhood but you could prove nothing there was never any evidence justonce in his whole life he had held in his hands unmistakable documentaryproof of the falsification of an historical fact and on that occasionsmith screamed the shrewish voice from the telescreen  smith wyes you bend lower please you can do better than that youre nottrying lower please thats better comrade now stand at ease thewhole squad and watch mea sudden hot sweat had broken out all over winstons body his faceremained completely inscrutable never show dismay never show resentmenta single flicker of the eyes could give you away he stood watching whilethe instructress raised her arms above her head andone could not saygracefully but with remarkable neatness and efficiencybent over andtucked the first joint of her fingers under her toesthere comrades thats how i want to see you doing it watch me againim thirtynine and ive had four children now look she bent over againyou see my knees arent bent you can all do it if you want to she addedas she straightened herself up anyone under fortyfive is perfectlycapable of touching his toes we dont all have the privilege of fightingin the front line but at least we can all keep fit remember our boys onthe malabar front and the sailors in the floating fortresses just thinkwhat they have to put up with now try again thats better comradethats much better she added encouragingly as winston with a violentlunge succeeded in touching his toes with knees unbent for the firsttime in several yearschapter with the deep unconscious sigh which not even the nearness of thetelescreen could prevent him from uttering when his days work startedwinston pulled the speakwrite towards him blew the dust from itsmouthpiece and put on his spectacles then he unrolled and clippedtogether four small cylinders of paper which had already flopped out ofthe pneumatic tube on the righthand side of his deskin the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices to the right of thespeakwrite a small pneumatic tube for written messages to the left alarger one for newspapers and in the side wall within easy reach ofwinstons arm a large oblong slit protected by a wire grating this lastwas for the disposal of waste paper similar slits existed in thousands ortens of thousands throughout the building not only in every room but atshort intervals in every corridor for some reason they were nicknamedmemory holes when one knew that any document was due for destruction oreven when one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about it was an automaticaction to lift the flap of the nearest memory hole and drop it inwhereupon it would be whirled away on a current of warm air to the enormousfurnaces which were hidden somewhere in the recesses of the buildingwinston examined the four slips of paper which he had unrolled eachcontained a message of only one or two lines in the abbreviatedjargonnot

satisfaction winston laid the fourth message asideit was an intricate and responsible job and had better be dealt with lastthe other three were routine matters though the second one would probablymean some tedious wading through lists of figureswinston dialled back numbers on the telescreen and called for theappropriate issues of the times which slid out of the pneumatic tubeafter only a few minutes delay the messages he had received referred toarticles or news items which for one reason or another it was thoughtnecessary to alter or as the official phrase had it to rectify forexample it appeared from the times of the seventeenth of march that bigbrother in his speech of the previous day had predicted that the southindian front would remain quiet but that a eurasian offensive would shortlybe launched in north africa as it happened the eurasian higher commandhad launched its offensive in south india and left north africa alone itwas therefore necessary to rewrite a paragraph of big brothers speech insuch a way as to make him predict the thing that had actually happened oragain the times of the nineteenth of december had published the officialforecasts of the output of various classes of consumption goods in thefourth quarter of  which was also the sixth quarter of the ninththreeyear plan todays issue contained a statement of the actual outputfrom which it appeared that the forecasts were in every instance grosslywrong winstons job was to rectify the original figures by making themagree with the later ones as for the third message it referred to a verysimple error which could be set right in a couple of minutes as shorta time ago as february the ministry of plenty had issued a promisea categorical pledge were the official words that there would beno reduction of the chocolate ration during  actually as winstonwas aware the chocolate ration was to be reduced from thirty grammesto twenty at the end of the present week all that was needed was tosubstitute for the original promise a warning that it would probably benecessary to reduce the ration at some time in aprilas soon as winston had dealt with each of the messages he clipped hisspeakwritten corrections to the appropriate copy of the times and pushedthem into the pneumatic tube then with a movement which was as nearly aspossible unconscious he crumpled up the original message and any notesthat he himself had made and dropped them into the memory hole to bedevoured by the flameswhat happened in the unseen labyrinth to which the pneumatic tubes led hedid not know in detail but he did know in general terms as soon as allthe corrections which happened to be necessary in any particular numberof the times had been assembled and collated that number would bereprinted the original copy destroyed and the corrected copy placed onthe files in its stead this process of continuous alteration was appliednot only to newspapers but to books periodicals pamphlets postersleaflets films soundtracks cartoons photographsto every kind ofliterature or documentation which might conceivably hold any political orideological significance day by day and almost minute by minute the pastwas brought up to date in this way every prediction made by the partycould be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct nor was anyitem of news or any expression of opinion which conflicted with theneeds of the moment ever allowed to remain on record all history wasa palimpsest scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as often as wasnecessary in no case would it have been possible once the deed was doneto prove that any falsification had taken place the largest section ofthe records department far larger than the one on which winston workedconsisted simply of persons whose duty it was to track down and collect allcopies of books newspapers and other documents which had been supersededand were due for destruction a number of the times which might becauseof changes in political alignment or mistaken prophecies uttered by bigbrother have been rewritten a dozen times still stood on the files bearingits original date and no other copy existed to contradict it books alsowere recalled and rewritten again and again and were invariably reissuedwithout any admission that any alteration had been made even the writteninstructions which winston received and which he invariably got rid ofas soon as he had dealt with them never stated or implied that an act offorgery was to be committed always the reference was to slips errorsmisprints or misquotations which it was necessary to put right in theinterests of accuracybut actually he thought as he readjusted the ministry of plentysfigures it was not even forgery it was merely the substitution of onepiece of nonsense for another most of the material that you were dealingwith had no connexion with anything in the real world not even the kind ofconnexion that is contained in a direct lie statistics were just as mucha fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version a greatdeal of the time you were expected to make them up out of your head forexample the ministry of plentys forecast had estimated the output ofboots for the quarter at  million pairs the actual output was given assixtytwo millions winston however in rewriting the forecast markedthe figure down to fiftyseven millions so as to allow for the usual claimthat the quota had been overfulfilled in any case sixtytwo millions wasno nearer the truth than fiftyseven millions or than  millions verylikely no boots had been produced at all likelier still nobody knewhow many had been produced much less cared all one knew was that everyquarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper while perhapshalf the population of oceania went barefoot and so it was with everyclass of recorded fact great or small everything faded away into ashadowworld in which finally even the date of the year had becomeuncertainwinston glanced across the hall in the corresponding cubicle on the otherside a small preciselooking darkchinned man named tillotson was workingsteadily away with a folded newspaper on his knee and his mouth very closeto the mouthpiece of the speakwrite he had the air of trying to keep whathe was saying a secret between himself and the telescreen he looked upand his spectacles darted a hostile flash in winstons directionwinston hardly knew tillotson and had no idea what work he was employedon people in the records department did not readily talk about their jobsin the long windowless hall with its double row of cubicles and itsendless rustle of papers and hum of voices murmuring into speakwritesthere were quite a dozen people whom winston did not even know by namethough he daily saw them hurrying to and fro in the corridors orgesticulating in the two minutes hate he knew that in the cubicle nextto him the little woman with sandy hair toiled day in day out simply attracking down and deleting from the press the names of people who had beenvaporized and were therefore considered never to have existed there was acertain fitness in this since her own husband had been vaporized a coupleof years earlier and a few cubicles away a mild ineffectual dreamycreature named ampleforth with very hairy ears and a surprising talentfor juggling with rhymes and metres was engaged in producing garbledversionsdefinitive texts they were calledof poems which had becomeideologically offensive but which for one reason or another were to beretained in the anthologies and this hall with its fifty workers orthereabouts was only one subsection a single cell as it were in thehuge complexity of the records department beyond above below were otherswarms of workers engaged in an unimaginable multitude of jobs there werethe huge printingshops with their subeditors their typography expertsand their elaborately equipped studios for the faking of photographs therewas the teleprogrammes section with its engineers its producers and itsteams of actors specially chosen for their skill in imitating voices therewere the armies of reference clerks whose job was simply to draw up listsof books and periodicals which were due for recall there were the vastrepositories where the corrected documents were stored and the hiddenfurnaces where the original copies were destroyed and somewhere or otherquite anonymous there were the directing brains who coordinated the wholeeffort and laid down the lines of policy which made it necessary that thisfragment of the past should be preserved that one falsified and the otherrubbed out of existenceand the records department after all was itself only a single branch ofthe ministry of truth whose primary job was not to reconstruct the pastbut to supply the citizens of oceania with newspapers films textbookstelescreen programmes plays novelswith every conceivable kind ofinformation instruction or entertainment from a statue to a sloganfrom a lyric poem to a biological treatise and from a childsspellingbook to a newspeak dictionary and the ministry had not only tosupply the multifarious needs of the party but also to repeat the wholeoperation at a lower level for the benefit of the proletariat therewas a whole chain of separate departments dealing with proletarianliterature music drama and entertainment generally here were producedrubbishy newspapers containing almost nothing except sport crime andastrology sensational fivecent novelettes films oozing with sex andsentimental songs which were composed entirely by mechanical means on aspecial kind of kaleidoscope known as a versificator there was evena whole subsectionpornosec it was called in newspeakengaged inproducing the lowest kind of pornography which was sent out in sealedpackets and which no party member other than those who worked on itwas permitted to look atthree messages had slid out of the pneumatic tube while winston wasworking but they were simple matters and he had disposed of them beforethe two minutes hate interrupted him when the hate was over he returnedto his cubicle took the newspeak dictionary from the shelf pushed thespeakwrite to one side cleaned his spectacles and settled down to hismain job of the morningwinstons greatest pleasure in life was in his work most of it was atedious routine but included in it there were also jobs so difficult andintricate that you could lose yourself in them as in the depths of amathematical problemdelicate pieces of forgery in which you had nothingto guide you except your knowledge of the principles of ingsoc and yourestimate of what the party wanted you to say winston was good at this kindof thing on occasion he had even been entrusted with the

and makes references to nonexistentpersons rewrite it in full and submit your draft to higher authoritybefore filingwinston read through the offending article big brothers order for theday it seemed had been chiefly devoted to praising the work of anorganization known as ffcc which supplied cigarettes and other comfortsto the sailors in the floating fortresses a certain comrade withers aprominent member of the inner party had been singled out for specialmention and awarded a decoration the order of conspicuous merit secondclassthree months later ffcc had suddenly been dissolved with no reasons givenone could assume that withers and his associates were now in disgrace butthere had been no report of the matter in the press or on the telescreenthat was to be expected since it was unusual for political offenders tobe put on trial or even publicly denounced the great purges involvingthousands of people with public trials of traitors and thoughtcriminalswho made abject confession of their crimes and were afterwards executedwere special showpieces not occurring oftener than once in a couple ofyears more commonly people who had incurred the displeasure of theparty simply disappeared and were never heard of again one never had thesmallest clue as to what had happened to them in some cases they mightnot even be dead perhaps thirty people personally known to winston notcounting his parents had disappeared at one time or anotherwinston stroked his nose gently with a paperclip in the cubicleacross the way comrade tillotson was still crouching secretively overhis speakwrite he raised his head for a moment again the hostilespectacleflash winston wondered whether comrade tillotson was engagedon the same job as himself it was perfectly possible so tricky a pieceof work would never be entrusted to a single person on the other handto turn it over to a committee would be to admit openly that an act offabrication was taking place very likely as many as a dozen people werenow working away on rival versions of what big brother had actually saidand presently some master brain in the inner party would select thisversion or that would reedit it and set in motion the complex processesof crossreferencing that would be required and then the chosen liewould pass into the permanent records and become truthwinston did not know why withers had been disgraced perhaps it was forcorruption or incompetence perhaps big brother was merely getting rid ofa toopopular subordinate perhaps withers or someone close to him hadbeen suspected of heretical tendencies or perhapswhat was likeliest ofallthe thing had simply happened because purges and vaporizations were anecessary part of the mechanics of government the only real clue lay inthe words refs unpersons which indicated that withers was already deadyou could not invariably assume this to be the case when people werearrested sometimes they were released and allowed to remain at libertyfor as much as a year or two years before being executed very occasionallysome person whom you had believed dead long since would make a ghostlyreappearance at some public trial where he would implicate hundreds ofothers by his testimony before vanishing this time for ever withershowever was already an unperson he did not exist he had never existedwinston decided that it would not be enough simply to reverse the tendencyof big brothers speech it was better to make it deal with somethingtotally unconnected with its original subjecthe might turn the speech into the usual denunciation of traitors andthoughtcriminals but that was a little too obvious while to invent avictory at the front or some triumph of overproduction in the ninththreeyear plan might complicate the records too much what was neededwas a piece of pure fantasy suddenly there sprang into his mind readymade as it were the image of a certain comrade ogilvy who had recentlydied in battle in heroic circumstances there were occasions when bigbrother devoted his order for the day to commemorating some humblerankandfile party member whose life and death he held up as an exampleworthy to be followed today he should commemorate comrade ogilvy it wastrue that there was no such person as comrade ogilvy but a few lines ofprint and a couple of faked photographs would soon bring him intoexistencewinston thought for a moment then pulled the speakwrite towards him andbegan dictating in big brothers familiar style a style at once militaryand pedantic and because of a trick of asking questions and thenpromptly answering them what lessons do we learn from this factcomrades the lessonwhich is also one of the fundamental principlesof ingsocthat etc etc easy to imitateat the age of three comrade ogilvy had refused all toys except a drum asubmachine gun and a model helicopter at sixa year early by a specialrelaxation of the ruleshe had joined the spies at nine he had been atroop leader at eleven he had denounced his uncle to the thought policeafter overhearing a conversation which appeared to him to have criminaltendencies at seventeen he had been a district organizer of the juniorantisex league at nineteen he had designed a handgrenade which hadbeen adopted by the ministry of peace and which at its first trial hadkilled thirtyone eurasian prisoners in one burst at twentythree he hadperished in action pursued by enemy jet planes while flying over theindian ocean with important despatches he had weighted his body with hismachine gun and leapt out of the helicopter into deep water despatchesand allan end said big brother which it was impossible to contemplatewithout feelings of envy big brother added a few remarks on the purityand singlemindedness of comrade ogilvys life he was a total abstainerand a nonsmoker had no recreations except a daily hour in the gymnasiumand had taken a vow of celibacy believing marriage and the care of afamily to be incompatible with a twentyfourhouraday devotion to dutyhe had no subjects of conversation except the principles of ingsoc andno aim in life except the defeat of the eurasian enemy and the huntingdownof spies saboteurs thoughtcriminals and traitors generallywinston debated with himself whether to award comrade ogilvy the order ofconspicuous merit in the end he decided against it because of theunnecessary crossreferencing that it would entailonce again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubicle somethingseemed to tell him with certainty that tillotson was busy on the same jobas himself there was no way of knowing whose job would finally be adoptedbut he felt a profound conviction that it would be his own comrade ogilvyunimagined an hour ago was now a fact it struck him as curious that youcould create dead men but not living ones comrade ogilvy who had neverexisted in the present now existed in the past and when once the act offorgery was forgotten he would exist just as authentically and upon thesame evidence as charlemagne or julius caesarchapter in the lowceilinged canteen deep underground the lunch queue jerkedslowly forward the room was already very full and deafeningly noisy fromthe grille at the counter the steam of stew came pouring forth with a sourmetallic smell which did not quite overcome the fumes of victory gin onthe far side of the room there was a small bar a mere hole in the wallwhere gin could be bought at ten cents the large nipjust the man i was looking for said a voice at winstons backhe turned round it was his friend syme who worked in the researchdepartment perhaps friend was not exactly the right word you did nothave friends nowadays you had comrades but there were some comrades whosesociety was pleasanter than that of others syme was a philologist aspecialist in newspeak indeed he was one of the enormous team of expertsnow engaged in compiling the eleventh edition of the newspeak dictionaryhe was a tiny creature smaller than winston with dark hair and largeprotuberant eyes at once mournful and derisive which seemed to searchyour face closely while he was speaking to youi wanted to ask you whether youd got any razor blades he saidnot one said winston with a sort of guilty haste ive tried all overthe place they dont exist any longereveryone kept asking you for razor blades actually he had two unused oneswhich he was hoarding up there had been a famine of them for months pastat any given moment there was some necessary article which the party shopswere unable to supply sometimes it was buttons sometimes it was darningwool sometimes it was shoelaces at present it was razor blades you couldonly get hold of them if at all by scrounging more or less furtively onthe free marketive been using the same blade for six weeks he added untruthfullythe queue gave another jerk forward as they halted he turned and facedsyme again each of them took a greasy metal tray from a pile at the endof the counterdid you go and see the prisoners hanged yesterday said symei was working said winston indifferently i shall see it on theflicks i supposea very inadequate substitute said symehis mocking eyes roved over winstons face i know you the eyes seemedto say i see through you i know very well why you didnt go to seethose prisoners hanged in an intellectual way syme was venomouslyorthodox he would talk with a disagreeable gloating satisfaction ofhelicopter raids on enemy villages and trials and confessions ofthoughtcriminals the executions in the cellars of the ministry of lovetalking to him was largely a matter of getting him away from such subjectsand entangling him if possible in the technicalities of newspeak onwhich he was authoritative and interesting winston turned his head alittle aside to avoid the scrutiny of the large dark eyesit was a good hanging said syme reminiscently i think it spoils itwhen they tie their feet together i like to see them kicking and aboveall at the end the tongue sticking right out and bluea quite brightblue thats the detail that appeals to menex please yelled the whiteaproned prole with the ladlewinston and syme pushed their trays beneath the grille on to each wasdumped swiftly the regulation luncha metal pannikin of pinkishgrey stewa hunk of bread a cube of cheese a mug of milkless victory coffee andone saccharine tablettheres a table over there under that telescreen said syme lets pickup a gin on the waythe gin was served out to them in handleless china mugs they threadedtheir way across the crowded room and unpacked their trays on to themetaltopped table on one corner of which someone had left a pool of stewa filthy liquid mess that had the appearance of vomit winston took up hismug of gin paused for an instant to collect his nerve and gulped theoilytasting stuff down when he had winked the tears out of his eyes hesuddenly discovered that he was hungry he began swallowing spoonfuls ofthe stew which in among its general sloppiness had cubes of spongypinkish stuff which was probably a preparation of meat neither of themspoke again till they had emptied their pannikins from the table atwinstons left a little behind his back someone was talking rapidly andcontinuously a harsh gabble almost like the quacking of a duck whichpierced the general uproar of the roomhow is the dictionary getting on said winston raising his voice toovercome the noiseslowly said syme im on the adjectives its fascinatinghe had brightened up immediately at the mention of newspeak he pushed hispannikin aside took up his hunk of bread in one delicate hand and hischeese in the other and leaned across the table so as to be able to speakwithout shoutingthe eleventh edition is the definitive edition he said were gettingthe language into its final shapethe shape its going to have when nobodyspeaks anything else when weve finished with it people like you willhave to learn it all over again you think i dare say that our chief jobis inventing new words but not a bit of it were destroying wordsscoresof them hundreds of them every day were cutting the language down tothe bone the eleventh edition wont contain a single word that will becomeobsolete before the year he bit hungrily into his bread and swallowed a couple of mouthfuls thencontinued speaking with a sort of pedants passion his thin dark facehad become animated his eyes had lost their mocking expression and grownalmost dreamyits a beautiful thing the destruction of words of course the greatwastage is in the verbs and adjectives but there are hundreds of nounsthat can be got rid of as well it isnt only the synonyms there are alsothe antonyms after all what justification is there for a word which issimply the opposite of some other word a word contains its opposite initself take good for instance if you have a word like good whatneed is there for a word like bad ungood will do just as wellbetterbecause its an exact opposite which the other is not or again if youwant a stronger version of good what sense is there in having a wholestring of vague useless words like excellent and splendid and all therest of them plusgood covers the meaning or doubleplusgood if youwant something stronger still of course we use those forms already butin the final version of newspeak therell be nothing else in the end thewhole notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six wordsinreality only one word dont you see the beauty of that winston it wasbbs idea originally of course he added as an afterthoughta sort of vapid eagerness flitted across winstons face at the mention ofbig brother nevertheless syme immediately detected a certain lack ofenthusiasmyou havent a real appreciation of newspeak winston he said almostsadly even when you write it youre still thinking in oldspeak ive readsome of those pieces that you write in the times occasionally theyregood enough but theyre translations in your heart youd prefer to stickto oldspeak with all its vagueness and its useless shades of meaningyou dont grasp the beauty of the destruction of words do you know thatnewspeak is the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smallerevery yearwinston did know that of course he smiled sympathetically he hoped nottrusting himself to speak syme bit off another fragment of thedarkcoloured bread chewed it briefly and went ondont you see that the whole aim of newspeak is to narrow the range ofthought in the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossiblebecause there will be no words in which to express it every concept thatcan ever be needed will be expressed by exactly one word with its meaningrigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgottenalready in the eleventh edition were not far from that point but theprocess will still be continuing long after you and i are dead every yearfewer and fewer words and the range of consciousness always a littlesmaller even now of course theres no reason or excuse for committingthoughtcrime its merely a question of selfdiscipline realitycontrolbut in the end there wont be any need even for that the revolution willbe complete when the language is perfect newspeak is ingsoc and ingsocis newspeak he added with a sort of mystical satisfaction has it everoccurred to you winston that by the year  at the very latest not asingle human being will be alive who could understand such a conversationas we are having nowexcept began winston doubtfully and he stoppedit had been on the tip of his tongue to say except the proles but hechecked himself not feeling fully certain that this remark was not insome way unorthodox syme however had divined what he was about to saythe proles are not human beings he said carelessly by earlierprobablyall real knowledge of oldspeak will have disappeared the wholeliterature of the past will have been destroyed chaucer shakespearemilton byrontheyll exist only in newspeak versions not merely changedinto something different but actually changed into something contradictoryof what they used to be even the literature of the party will changeeven the slogans will change how could you have a slogan like freedom isslavery when the concept of freedom has been abolished the whole climateof thought will be different in fact there will be no thought as weunderstand it now orthodoxy means not thinkingnot needing to thinkorthodoxy is unconsciousnessone of these days thought winston with sudden deep conviction syme willbe vaporized he is too intelligent he sees too clearly and speaks tooplainly the party does not like such people one day he will disappearit is written in his facewinston had finished his bread and cheese he turned a little sidewaysin his chair to drink his mug of coffee at the table on his left the manwith the strident voice was still talking remorselessly away a youngwoman who was perhaps his secretary and who was sitting with her backto winston was listening to him and seemed to be eagerly agreeing witheverything that he said from time to time winston caught some such remarkas i think youre so right i do so agree with you uttered in a youthfuland rather silly feminine voice but the other voice never stopped for aninstant even when the girl was speaking winston knew the man by sightthough he knew no more about him than that he held some important postin the fiction department he was a man of about thirty with a muscularthroat and a large mobile mouth his head was thrown back a little andbecause of the angle at which he was sitting his spectacles caught thelight and presented to winston two blank discs instead of eyes what wasslightly horrible was that from the stream of sound that poured out ofhis mouth it was almost impossible to distinguish a single word justonce winston caught a phrasecomplete and final elimination ofgoldsteinismjerked out very rapidly and as it seemed all in one piecelike a line of type cast solid for the rest it was just a noise aquackquackquacking and yet though you could not actually hear what theman was saying you could not be in any doubt about its general naturehe might be denouncing goldstein and demanding sterner measures againstthoughtcriminals and saboteurs he might be fulminating against theatrocities of the eurasian army he might be praising big brother or theheroes on the malabar frontit made no difference whatever it was youcould be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy pure ingsocas he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving rapidly up and downwinston had a curious feeling that this was not a real human being butsome kind of dummy it was not the mans brain that was speaking it washis larynx the stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words butit was not speech in the true sense it was a noise uttered inunconsciousness like the quacking of a ducksyme had fallen silent for a moment and with the handle of his spoon wastracing patterns in the puddle of stew the voice from the other tablequacked rapidly on easily audible in spite of the surrounding dinthere is a word in newspeak said syme i dont know whether you knowit duckspeak to quack like a duck it is one of those interesting wordsthat have two contradictory meanings applied to an opponent it is abuseapplied to someone you agree with it is praiseunquestionably syme will be vaporized winston thought again he thoughtit with a kind of sadness although well knowing that syme despised himand slightly disliked him and was fully capable of denouncing him as athoughtcriminal if he saw any reason for doing so there was somethingsubtly wrong with syme there was something that he lacked discretionaloofness a sort of saving stupidity you could not say that he wasunorthodox he believed in the principles of ingsoc he venerated bigbrother he rejoiced over victories he hated heretics not merely withsincerity but with a sort of restless zeal an uptodateness ofinformation which the ordinary party member did not approach yet a faintair of disreputability always clung to him he said things that would havebeen better unsaid he had read too many books he frequented the chestnuttree cafe haunt of painters and musicians there was no law not even anunwritten law against frequenting the chestnut tree cafe yet the placewas somehow illomened the old discredited leaders of the party had beenused to gather there before they were finally purged goldstein himselfit was said had sometimes been seen there years and decades ago symesfate was not difficult to foresee and yet it was a fact that if symegrasped even for three seconds the nature of his winstons secretopinions he would betray him instantly to the thought police so wouldanybody else for that matter but syme more than most zeal was notenough orthodoxy was unconsciousnesssyme looked up here comes parsons he saidsomething in the tone of his voice seemed to add that bloody foolparsons winstons fellowtenant at victory mansions was in fact threadinghis way across the rooma tubby middlesized man with fair hair and afroglike face at thirtyfive he was already putting on rolls of fat atneck and waistline but his movements were brisk and boyish his wholeappearance was that of a little boy grown large so much so that althoughhe was wearing the regulation overalls it was almost impossible not tothink of him as being dressed in the blue shorts grey shirt and redneckerchief of the spies in visualizing him one saw always a picture ofdimpled knees and sleeves rolled back from pudgy forearms parsons didindeed invariably revert to shorts when a community hike or any otherphysical activity gave him an excuse for doing so he greeted them bothwith a cheery hullo hullo and sat down at the table giving off anintense smell of sweat beads of moisture stood out all over his pink facehis powers of sweating were extraordinary at the community centre youcould always tell when he had been playing tabletennis by the dampness ofthe bat handle syme had produced a strip of paper on which there was along column of words and was studying it with an inkpencil between hisfingerslook at him working away in the lunch hour said parsons nudgingwinston keenness eh whats that youve got there old boy somethinga bit too brainy for me i expect smith old boy ill tell you why imchasing you its that sub you forgot to give mewhich sub is that said winston automatically feeling for money abouta quarter of ones salary had to be earmarked for voluntary subscriptionswhich were so numerous that it was difficult to keep track of themfor hate week you knowthe housebyhouse fund im treasurer for ourblock were making an allout effortgoing to put on a tremendous showi tell you it wont be my fault if old victory mansions doesnt have thebiggest outfit of flags in the whole street two dollars you promised mewinston found and handed over two creased and filthy notes which parsonsentered in a small notebook in the neat handwriting of the illiterateby the way old boy he said i hear that little beggar of mine let flyat you with his catapult yesterday i gave him a good dressingdown for itin fact i told him id take the catapult away if he does it againi think he was a little upset at not going to the execution saidwinstonah wellwhat i mean to say shows the right spirit doesnt itmischievous little beggars they are both of them but talk about keennessall they think about is the spies and the war of course dyou know whatthat little girl of mine did last saturday when her troop was on a hikeout berkhamsted way she got two other girls to go with her slipped offfrom the hike and spent the whole afternoon following a strange man theykept on his tail for two hours right through the woods and then whenthey got into amersham handed him over to the patrolswhat did they do that for said winston somewhat taken aback parsonswent on triumphantlymy kid made sure he was some kind of enemy agentmight have been droppedby parachute for instance but heres the point old boy what do youthink put her on to him in the first place she spotted he was wearing afunny kind of shoessaid shed never seen anyone wearing shoes like thatbefore so the chances were he was a foreigner pretty smart for a nipperof seven ehwhat happened to the man said winstonah that i couldnt say of course but i wouldnt be altogether surprisedif parsons made the motion of aiming a rifle and clicked his tonguefor the explosiongood said syme abstractedly without looking up from his strip of paperof course we cant afford to take chances agreed winston dutifullywhat i mean to say there is a war on said parsonsas though in confirmation of this a trumpet call floated from thetelescreen just above their heads however it was not the proclamation ofa military victory this time but merely an announcement from the ministryof plentycomrades cried an eager youthful voice attention comrades we haveglorious news for you we have won the battle for production returns nowcompleted of the output of all classes of consumption goods show that thestandard of living has risen by no less than  per cent over the pastyear all over oceania this morning there were irrepressible spontaneousdemonstrations when workers marched out of factories and offices andparaded through the streets with banners voicing their gratitude to bigbrother for the new happy life which his wise leadership has bestowedupon us here are some of the completed figures foodstuffsthe phrase our new happy life recurred several times it had been afavourite of late with the ministry of plenty parsons his attentioncaught by the trumpet call sat listening with a sort of gaping solemnitya sort of edified boredom he could not follow the figures but he wasaware that they were in some way a cause for satisfaction he had luggedout a huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charred tobaccowith the tobacco ration at  grammes a week it was seldom possible tofill a pipe to the top winston was smoking a victory cigarette which heheld carefully horizontal the new ration did not start till tomorrow andhe had only four cigarettes left for the moment he had shut his ears tothe remoter noises and was listening to the stuff that streamed out of thetelescreen it appeared that there had even been demonstrations to thankbig brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week andonly yesterday he reflected it had been announced that the ration wasto be reduced to twenty grammes a week was it possible that they couldswallow that after only twentyfour hours yes they swallowed it parsonsswallowed it easily with the stupidity of an animal the eyeless creatureat the other table swallowed it fanatically passionately with a furiousdesire to track down denounce and vaporize anyone who should suggest thatlast week the ration had been thirty grammes syme tooin some morecomplex way involving doublethink syme swallowed it was he then alonein the possession of a memorythe fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen ascompared with last year there was more food more clothes more housesmore furniture more cookingpots more fuel more ships more helicoptersmore books more babiesmore of everything except disease crime andinsanity year by year and minute by minute everybody and everything waswhizzing rapidly upwards as syme had done earlier winston had taken uphis spoon and was dabbling in the palecoloured gravy that dribbled acrossthe table drawing a long streak of it out into a pattern he meditatedresentfully on the physical texture of life had it always been likethis had food always tasted like this he looked round the canteena lowceilinged crowded room its walls grimy from the contact ofinnumerable bodies battered metal tables and chairs placed so closetogether that you sat with elbows touching bent spoons dented trayscoarse white mugs all surfaces greasy grime in every crack and asourish composite smell of bad gin and bad coffee and metallic stew anddirty clothes always in your stomach and in your skin there was a sortof protest a feeling that you had been cheated of something that you hada right to it was true that he had no memories of anything greatlydifferent in any time that he could accurately remember there had neverbeen quite enough to eat one had never had socks or underclothes thatwere not full of holes furniture had always been battered and ricketyrooms underheated tube trains crowded houses falling to piecesbread darkcoloured tea a rarity coffee filthytasting cigarettesinsufficientnothing cheap and plentiful except synthetic gin and thoughof course it grew worse as ones body aged was it not a sign that thiswas not the natural order of things if ones heart sickened at thediscomfort and dirt and scarcity the interminable winters the stickinessof ones socks the lifts that never worked the cold water the grittysoap the cigarettes that came to pieces the food with its strange eviltastes why should one feel it to be intolerable unless one had some kindof ancestral memory that things had once been differenthe looked round the canteen again nearly everyone was ugly and wouldstill have been ugly even if dressed otherwise than in the uniform blueoveralls on the far side of the room sitting at a table alone a smallcuriously beetlelike man was drinking a cup of coffee his little eyesdarting suspicious glances from side to side how easy it was thoughtwinston if you did not look about you to believe that the physical typeset up by the party as an idealtall muscular youths and deepbosomedmaidens blondhaired vital sunburnt carefreeexisted and evenpredominated actually so far as he could judge the majority of peoplein airstrip one were small dark and illfavoured it was curious how thatbeetlelike type proliferated in the ministries little dumpy men growingstout very early in life with short legs swift scuttling movements andfat inscrutable faces with very small eyes it was the type that seemed toflourish best under the dominion of the partythe announcement from the ministry of plenty ended on another trumpet calland gave way to tinny music parsons stirred to vague enthusiasm by thebombardment of figures took his pipe out of his mouththe ministry of plentys certainly done a good job this year he saidwith a knowing shake of his head by the way smith old boy i supposeyou havent got any razor blades you can let me havenot one said winston ive been using the same blade for six weeksmyselfah welljust thought id ask you old boysorry said winstonthe quacking voice from the next table temporarily silenced during theministrys announcement had started up again as loud as ever for somereason winston suddenly found himself thinking of mrs parsons with herwispy hair and the dust in the creases of her face within two years thosechildren would be denouncing her to the thought police mrs parsons wouldbe vaporized syme would be vaporized winston would be vaporized obrienwould be vaporized parsons on the other hand would never be vaporizedthe eyeless creature with the quacking voice would never be vaporizedthe little beetlelike men who scuttle so nimbly through the labyrinthinecorridors of ministries they too would never be vaporized and the girlwith dark hair the girl from the fiction departmentshe would never bevaporized either it seemed to him that he knew instinctively who wouldsurvive and who would perish though just what it was that made forsurvival it was not easy to sayat this moment he was dragged out of his reverie with a violent jerk thegirl at the next table had turned partly round and was looking at him itwas the girl with dark hair she was looking at him in a sidelong way butwith curious intensity the instant she caught his eye she looked awayagainthe sweat started out on winstons backbone a horrible pang of terrorwent through him it was gone almost at once but it left a sort of nagginguneasiness behind why was she watching him why did she keep following himabout unfortunately he could not remember whether she had already been atthe table when he arrived or had come there afterwards but yesterday atany rate during the two minutes hate she had sat immediately behind himwhen there was no apparent need to do so quite likely her real object hadbeen to listen to him and make sure whether he was shouting loudly enoughhis earlier thought returned to him probably she was not actually a memberof the thought police but then it was precisely the amateur spy who wasthe greatest danger of all he did not know how long she had been lookingat him but perhaps for as much as five minutes and it was possiblethat his features had not been perfectly under control it was terriblydangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public placeor within range of a telescreen the smallest thing could give you awaya nervous tic an unconscious look of anxiety a habit of muttering toyourselfanything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality ofhaving something to hide in any case to wear an improper expression onyour face to look incredulous when a victory was announced for examplewas itself a punishable offence there was even a word for it in newspeakfacecrime it was calledthe girl had turned her back on him again perhaps after all she was notreally following him about perhaps it was coincidence that she had sat soclose to him two days running his cigarette had gone out and he laid itcarefully on the edge of the table he would finish smoking it after workif he could keep the tobacco in it quite likely the person at the nexttable was a spy of the thought police and quite likely he would be in thecellars of the ministry of love within three days but a cigarette endmust not be wasted syme had folded up his strip of paper and stowed itaway in his pocket parsons had begun talking againdid i ever tell you old boy he said chuckling round the stem of hispipe about the time when those two nippers of mine set fire to the oldmarketwomans skirt because they saw her wrapping up sausages in a posterof bb sneaked up behind her and set fire to it with a box of matchesburned her quite badly i believe little beggars eh but keen as mustardthats a firstrate training they give them in the spies nowadaysbetterthan in my day even what dyou thinks the latest thing theyve servedthem out with ear trumpets for listening through keyholes my littlegirl brought one home the other nighttried it out on our sittingroomdoor and reckoned she could hear twice as much as with her ear to thehole of course its only a toy mind you still gives em the rightidea ehat this moment the telescreen let out a piercing whistle it was thesignal to return to work all three men sprang to their feet to join inthe struggle round the lifts and the remaining tobacco fell out ofwinstons cigarettechapter winston was writing in his diary   it was three years ago it was on a dark evening in a narrowsidestreet near one of the big railway stations she was standing near adoorway in the wall under a street lamp that hardly gave any light shehad a young face painted very thick it was really the paint that appealedto me the whiteness of it like a mask and the bright red lips partywomen never paint their faces there was nobody else in the street and notelescreens she said two dollars ifor the moment it was too difficult to go on he shut his eyes and pressedhis fingers against them trying to squeeze out the vision that keptrecurring he had an almost overwhelming temptation to shout a string offilthy words at the top of his voice or to bang his head against the wallto kick over the table and hurl the inkpot through the windowto do anyviolent or noisy or painful thing that might black out the memory that wastormenting himyour worst enemy he reflected was your own nervous system at any momentthe tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some visiblesymptom he thought of a man whom he had passed in the street a few weeksback a quite ordinarylooking man a party member aged thirtyfive toforty tallish and thin carrying a briefcase they were a few metresapart when the left side of the mans face was suddenly contorted by a sortof spasm it happened again just as they were passing one another it wasonly a twitch a quiver rapid as the clicking of a camera shutter butobviously habitual he remembered thinking at the time that poor devil isdone for and what was frightening was that the action was quite possiblyunconscious the most deadly danger of all was talking in your sleep therewas no way of guarding against that so far as he could seehe drew his breath and went on writing   i went with her through the doorway and across a backyard into abasement kitchen there was a bed against the wall and a lamp on thetable turned down very low shehis teeth were set on edge he would have liked to spit simultaneouslywith the woman in the basement kitchen he thought of katharine his wifewinston was marriedhad been married at any rate probably he still wasmarried so far as he knew his wife was not dead he seemed to breatheagain the warm stuffy odour of the basement kitchen an odour compoundedof bugs and dirty clothes and villainous cheap scent but neverthelessalluring because no woman of the party ever used scent or could beimagined as doing so only the proles used scent in his mind the smellof it was inextricably mixed up with fornicationwhen he had gone with that woman it had been his first lapse in two yearsor thereabouts consorting with prostitutes was forbidden of course butit was one of those rules that you could occasionally nerve yourself tobreak it was dangerous but it was not a lifeanddeath matter to becaught with a prostitute might mean five years in a forcedlabour campnot more if you had committed no other offence and it was easy enoughprovided that you could avoid being caught in the act the poorer quartersswarmed with women who were ready to sell themselves some could even bepurchased for a bottle of gin which the proles were not supposed to drinktacitly the party was even inclined to encourage prostitution as an outletfor instincts which could not be altogether suppressed mere debaucherydid not matter very much so long as it was furtive and joyless and onlyinvolved the women of a submerged and despised class the unforgivablecrime was promiscuity between party members butthough this was oneof the crimes that the accused in the great purges invariably confessedtoit was difficult to imagine any such thing actually happeningthe aim of the party was not merely to prevent men and women from formingloyalties which it might not be able to control its real undeclaredpurpose was to remove all pleasure from the sexual act not love so muchas eroticism was the enemy inside marriage as well as outside it allmarriages between party members had to be approved by a committeeappointed for the purpose andthough the principle was never clearlystatedpermission was always refused if the couple concerned gavethe impression of being physically attracted to one another the onlyrecognized purpose of marriage was to beget children for the service ofthe party sexual intercourse was to be looked on as a slightly disgustingminor operation like having an enema this again was never put into plainwords but in an indirect way it was rubbed into every party member fromchildhood onwards there were even organizations such as the juniorantisex league which advocated complete celibacy for both sexes allchildren were to be begotten by artificial insemination artsem it wascalled in newspeak and brought up in public institutions this winstonwas aware was not meant altogether seriously but somehow it fitted inwith the general ideology of the party the party was trying to kill thesex instinct or if it could not be killed then to distort it and dirtyit he did not know why this was so but it seemed natural that it shouldbe so and as far as the women were concerned the partys efforts werelargely successfulhe thought again of katharine it must be nine tennearly eleven yearssince they had parted it was curious how seldom he thought of her fordays at a time he was capable of forgetting that he had ever been marriedthey had only been together for about fifteen months the party did notpermit divorce but it rather encouraged separation in cases where therewere no childrenkatharine was a tall fairhaired girl very straight with splendidmovements she had a bold aquiline face a face that one might have callednoble until one discovered that there was as nearly as possible nothingbehind it very early in her married life he had decidedthough perhapsit was only that he knew her more intimately than he knew most peoplethatshe had without exception the most stupid vulgar empty mind that he hadever encountered she had not a thought in her head that was not a sloganand there was no imbecility absolutely none that she was not capable ofswallowing if the party handed it out to her the human soundtrack henicknamed her in his own mind yet he could have endured living with herif it had not been for just one thingsexas soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiffen to embrace herwas like embracing a jointed wooden image and what was strange was thateven when she was clasping him against her he had the feeling that shewas simultaneously pushing him away with all her strength the rigidityof her muscles managed to convey that impression she would lie therewith shut eyes neither resisting nor cooperating but submitting it wasextraordinarily embarrassing and after a while horrible but even thenhe could have borne living with her if it had been agreed that they shouldremain celibate but curiously enough it was katharine who refused thisthey must she said produce a child if they could so the performancecontinued to happen once a week quite regularly whenever it was notimpossible she even used to remind him of it in the morning as somethingwhich had to be done that evening and which must not be forgotten she hadtwo names for it one was making a baby and the other was our duty tothe party yes she had actually used that phrase quite soon he grew tohave a feeling of positive dread when the appointed day came round butluckily no child appeared and in the end she agreed to give up tryingand soon afterwards they partedwinston sighed inaudibly he picked up his pen again andwrote   she threw herself down on the bed and at once without any kind ofpreliminary in the most coarse horrible way you can imagine pulled upher skirt ihe saw himself standing there in the dim lamplight with the smell of bugsand cheap scent in his nostrils and in his heart a feeling of defeat andresentment which even at that moment was mixed up with the thought ofkatharines white body frozen for ever by the hypnotic power of the partywhy did it always have to be like this why could he not have a woman ofhis own instead of these filthy scuffles at intervals of years but a reallove affair was an almost unthinkable event the women of the party wereall alike chastity was as deep ingrained in them as party loyalty bycareful early conditioning by games and cold water by the rubbish thatwas dinned into them at school and in the spies and the youth league bylectures parades songs slogans and martial music the natural feelinghad been driven out of them his reason told him that there must beexceptions but his heart did not believe it they were all impregnableas the party intended that they should be and what he wanted more eventhan to be loved was to break down that wall of virtue even if it wereonly once in his whole life the sexual act successfully performed wasrebellion desire was thoughtcrime even to have awakened katharine if hecould have achieved it would have been like a seduction although she washis wifebut the rest of the story had got to be written down he wrote   i turned up the lamp when i saw her in the lightafter the darkness the feeble light of the paraffin lamp had seemed verybright for the first time he could see the woman properly he had taken astep towards her and then halted full of lust and terror he was painfullyconscious of the risk he had taken in coming here it was perfectlypossible that the patrols would catch him on the way out for that matterthey might be waiting outside the door at this moment if he went awaywithout even doing what he had come here to doit had got to be written down it had got to be confessed what he hadsuddenly seen in the lamplight was that the woman was old the paint wasplastered so thick on her face that it looked as though it might cracklike a cardboard mask there were streaks of white in her hair but thetruly dreadful detail was that her mouth had fallen a little openrevealing nothing except a cavernous blackness she had no teeth at allhe wrote hurriedly in scrabbling handwriting   when i saw her in the light she was quite an old woman fifty years oldat least but i went ahead and did it just the samehe pressed his fingers against his eyelids again he had written it downat last but it made no difference the therapy had not worked the urgeto shout filthy words at the top of his voice was as strong as everchapter if there is hope wrote winston it lies in the prolesif there was hope it must lie in the proles because only there in thoseswarming disregarded masses  per cent of the population of oceaniacould the force to destroy the party ever be generated the party couldnot be overthrown from within its enemies if it had any enemies hadno way of coming together or even of identifying one another even ifthe legendary brotherhood existed as just possibly it might it wasinconceivable that its members could ever assemble in larger numbers thantwos and threes rebellion meant a look in the eyes an inflexion of thevoice at the most an occasional whispered word but the proles if onlythey could somehow become conscious of their own strength would have noneed to conspire they needed only to rise up and shake themselves likea horse shaking off flies if they chose they could blow the party topieces tomorrow morning surely sooner or later it must occur to them todo it and yethe remembered how once he had been walking down a crowded street when atremendous shout of hundreds of voices womens voiceshad burst from asidestreet a little way ahead it was a great formidable cry of angerand despair a deep loud ohooooh that went humming on like thereverberation of a bell his heart had leapt its started he had thoughta riot the proles are breaking loose at last when he had reached the spotit was to see a mob of two or three hundred women crowding round the stallsof a street market with faces as tragic as though they had been the doomedpassengers on a sinking ship but at this moment the general despair brokedown into a multitude of individual quarrels it appeared that one of thestalls had been selling tin saucepans they were wretched flimsy thingsbut cookingpots of any kind were always difficult to get now the supplyhad unexpectedly given out the successful women bumped and jostled bythe rest were trying to make off with their saucepans while dozens ofothers clamoured round the stall accusing the stallkeeper of favouritismand of having more saucepans somewhere in reserve there was a freshoutburst of yells two bloated women one of them with her hair comingdown had got hold of the same saucepan and were trying to tear it out ofone anothers hands for a moment they were both tugging and then thehandle came off winston watched them disgustedly and yet just for amoment what almost frightening power had sounded in that cry from onlya few hundred throats why was it that they could never shout like thatabout anything that matteredhe wrote   until they become conscious they will never rebel and until after theyhave rebelled they cannot become consciousthat he reflected might almost have been a transcription from one of theparty textbooks the party claimed of course to have liberated the prolesfrom bondage before the revolution they had been hideously oppressed bythe capitalists they had been starved and flogged women had been forcedto work in the coal mines women still did work in the coal mines as amatter of fact children had been sold into the factories at the ageof six but simultaneously true to the principles of doublethink theparty taught that the proles were natural inferiors who must be kept insubjection like animals by the application of a few simple rules inreality very little was known about the proles it was not necessary toknow much so long as they continued to work and breed their otheractivities were without importance left to themselves like cattle turnedloose upon the plains of argentina they had reverted to a style of lifethat appeared to be natural to them a sort of ancestral pattern they wereborn they grew up in the gutters they went to work at twelve they passedthrough a brief blossomingperiod of beauty and sexual desire they marriedat twenty they were middleaged at thirty they died for the most partat sixty heavy physical work the care of home and children pettyquarrels with neighbours films football beer and above all gamblingfilled up the horizon of their minds to keep them in control was notdifficult a few agents of the thought police moved always among themspreading false rumours and marking down and eliminating the fewindividuals who were judged capable of becoming dangerous but no attemptwas made to indoctrinate them with the ideology of the party it was notdesirable that the proles should have strong political feelings all thatwas required of them was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed towhenever it was necessary to make them accept longer workinghours orshorter rations and even when they became discontented as they sometimesdid their discontent led nowhere because being without general ideasthey could only focus it on petty specific grievances the larger evilsinvariably escaped their notice the great majority of proles did not evenhave telescreens in their homes even the civil police interfered with themvery little there was a vast amount of criminality in london a wholeworldwithinaworld of thieves bandits prostitutes drugpeddlers andracketeers of every description but since it all happened among the prolesthemselves it was of no importance in all questions of morals they wereallowed to follow their ancestral code the sexual puritanism of theparty was not imposed upon them promiscuity went unpunished divorcewas permitted for that matter even religious worship would have beenpermitted if the proles had shown any sign of needing or wanting itthey were beneath suspicion as the party slogan put it proles andanimals are freewinston reached down and cautiously scratched his varicose ulcer ithad begun itching again the thing you invariably came back to was theimpossibility of knowing what life before the revolution had really beenlike he took out of the drawer a copy of a childrens history textbookwhich he had borrowed from mrs parsons and began copying a passage intothe diary   in the old days it ran before the glorious revolution london wasnot the beautiful city that we know today it was a dark dirty miserableplace where hardly anybody had enough to eat and where hundreds andthousands of poor people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof tosleep under children no older than you had to work twelve hours a day forcruel masters who flogged them with whips if they worked too slowly andfed them on nothing but stale breadcrusts and water but in among allthis terrible poverty there were just a few great big beautiful housesthat were lived in by rich men who had as many as thirty servants to lookafter them these rich men were called capitalists they were fat uglymen with wicked faces like the one in the picture on the opposite pageyou can see that he is dressed in a long black coat which was called afrock coat and a queer shiny hat shaped like a stovepipe which wascalled a top hat this was the uniform of the capitalists and no one elsewas allowed to wear it the capitalists owned everything in the world andeveryone else was their slave they owned all the land all the housesall the factories and all the money if anyone disobeyed them they couldthrow them into prison or they could take his job away and starve him todeath when any ordinary person spoke to a capitalist he had to cringe andbow to him and take off his cap and address him as sir the chief ofall the capitalists was called the king andbut he knew the rest of the catalogue there would be mention of thebishops in their lawn sleeves the judges in their ermine robes thepillory the stocks the treadmill the catonine tails the lord mayorsbanquet and the practice of kissing the popes toe there was alsosomething called the jus primae noctis which would probably not bementioned in a textbook for children it was the law by which everycapitalist had the right to sleep with any woman working in one of hisfactorieshow could you tell how much of it was lies it might be true that theaverage human being was better off now than he had been before therevolution the only evidence to the contrary was the mute protest in yourown bones the instinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in wereintolerable and that at some other time they must have been different itstruck him that the truly characteristic thing about modern life was notits cruelty and insecurity but simply its bareness its dinginess itslistlessness life if you looked about you bore no resemblance not onlyto the lies that streamed out of the telescreens but even to the idealsthat the party was trying to achieve great areas of it even for a partymember were neutral and nonpolitical a matter of slogging through drearyjobs fighting for a place on the tube darning a wornout sock cadginga saccharine tablet saving a cigarette end the ideal set up by theparty was something huge terrible and glitteringa world of steeland concrete of monstrous machines and terrifying weaponsa nation ofwarriors and fanatics marching forward in perfect unity all thinking thesame thoughts and shouting the same slogans perpetually working fightingtriumphing persecutingthree hundred million people all with the sameface the reality was decaying dingy cities where underfed people shuffledto and fro in leaky shoes in patchedup nineteenthcentury houses thatsmelt always of cabbage and bad lavatories he seemed to see a vision oflondon vast and ruinous city of a million dustbins and mixed up with itwas a picture of mrs parsons a woman with lined face and wispy hairfiddling helplessly with a blocked wastepipehe reached down and scratched his ankle again day and night thetelescreens bruised your ears with statistics proving that people todayhad more food more clothes better houses better recreationsthat theylived longer worked shorter hours were bigger healthier strongerhappier more intelligent better educated than the people of fifty yearsago not a word of it could ever be proved or disproved the party claimedfor example that today  per cent of adult proles were literate beforethe revolution it was said the number had only been  per cent theparty claimed that the infant mortality rate was now only  perthousand whereas before the revolution it had been and so it wenton it was like a single equation with two unknowns it might very well bethat literally every word in the history books even the things that oneaccepted without question was pure fantasy for all he knew there mightnever have been any such law as the jus primae noctis or any such creatureas a capitalist or any such garment as a top hateverything faded into mist the past was erased the erasure was forgottenthe lie became truth just once in his life he had possessedafter theevent that was what countedconcrete unmistakable evidence of an act offalsification he had held it between his fingers for as long as thirtyseconds in  it must have beenat any rate it was at about the timewhen he and katharine had parted but the really relevant date was sevenor eight years earlierthe story really began in the middle sixties the period of the greatpurges in which the original leaders of the revolution were wiped outonce and for all by  none of them was left except big brotherhimself all the rest had by that time been exposed as traitors andcounterrevolutionaries goldstein had fled and was hiding no one knewwhere and of the others a few had simply disappeared while the majorityhad been executed after spectacular public trials at which they madeconfession of their crimes among the last survivors were three men namedjones aaronson and rutherford it must have been in  that these threehad been arrested as often happened they had vanished for a year or moreso that one did not know whether they were alive or dead and then hadsuddenly been brought forth to incriminate themselves in the usual waythey had confessed to intelligence with the enemy at that date too theenemy was eurasia embezzlement of public funds the murder of varioustrusted party members intrigues against the leadership of big brotherwhich had started long before the revolution happened and acts of sabotagecausing the death of hundreds of thousands of people after confessing tothese things they had been pardoned reinstated in the party and givenposts which were in fact sinecures but which sounded important all threehad written long abject articles in the times analysing the reasonsfor their defection and promising to make amendssome time after their release winston had actually seen all three of themin the chestnut tree cafe he remembered the sort of terrified fascinationwith which he had watched them out of the corner of his eye they were menfar older than himself relics of the ancient world almost the last greatfigures left over from the heroic days of the party the glamour of theunderground struggle and the civil war still faintly clung to them he hadthe feeling though already at that time facts and dates were growingblurry that he had known their names years earlier than he had known thatof big brother but also they were outlaws enemies untouchables doomedwith absolute certainty to extinction within a year or two no one who hadonce fallen into the hands of the thought police ever escaped in the endthey were corpses waiting to be sent back to the gravethere was no one at any of the tables nearest to them it was not wiseeven to be seen in the neighbourhood of such people they were sittingin silence before glasses of the gin flavoured with cloves which was thespeciality of the cafe of the three it was rutherford whose appearancehad most impressed winston rutherford had once been a famous caricaturistwhose brutal cartoons had helped to inflame popular opinion before andduring the revolution even now at long intervals his cartoons wereappearing in the times they were simply an imitation of his earliermanner and curiously lifeless and unconvincing always they were arehashing of the ancient themesslum tenements starving children streetbattles capitalists in top hatseven on the barricades the capitalistsstill seemed to cling to their top hats an endless hopeless effort toget back into the past he was a monstrous man with a mane of greasygrey hair his face pouched and seamed with thick negroid lips at onetime he must have been immensely strong now his great body was saggingsloping bulging falling away in every direction he seemed to be breakingup before ones eyes like a mountain crumblingit was the lonely hour of fifteen winston could not now remember how hehad come to be in the cafe at such a time the place was almost empty atinny music was trickling from the telescreens the three men sat in theircorner almost motionless never speaking uncommanded the waiter broughtfresh glasses of gin there was a chessboard on the table beside them withthe pieces set out but no game started and then for perhaps half a minutein all something happened to the telescreens the tune that they wereplaying changed and the tone of the music changed too there came intoitbut it was something hard to describe it was a peculiar crackedbraying jeering note in his mind winston called it a yellow note andthen a voice from the telescreen was singing  under the spreading chestnut tree  i sold you and you sold me  there lie they and here lie we  under the spreading chestnut treethe three men never stirred but when winston glanced again at rutherfordsruinous face he saw that his eyes were full of tears and for the firsttime he noticed with a kind of inward shudder and yet not knowingat what he shuddered that both aaronson and rutherford had broken nosesa little later all three were rearrested it appeared that they hadengaged in fresh conspiracies from the very moment of their release attheir second trial they confessed to all their old crimes over again witha whole string of new ones they were executed and their fate was recordedin the party histories a warning to posterity about five years afterthis in  winston was unrolling a wad of documents which had justflopped out of the pneumatic tube on to his desk when he came on a fragmentof paper which had evidently been slipped in among the others and thenforgotten the instant he had flattened it out he saw its significanceit was a halfpage torn out of the times of about ten years earlierthetop half of the page so that it included the dateand it contained aphotograph of the delegates at some party function in new york prominentin the middle of the group were jones aaronson and rutherford there wasno mistaking them in any case their names were in the caption at thebottomthe point was that at both trials all three men had confessed that on thatdate they had been on eurasian soil they had flown from a secret airfieldin canada to a rendezvous somewhere in siberia and had conferred withmembers of the eurasian general staff to whom they had betrayed importantmilitary secrets the date had stuck in winstons memory because it chancedto be midsummer day but the whole story must be on record in countlessother places as well there was only one possible conclusion theconfessions were liesof course this was not in itself a discovery even at that time winstonhad not imagined that the people who were wiped out in the purges hadactually committed the crimes that they were accused of but this wasconcrete evidence it was a fragment of the abolished past like a fossilbone which turns up in the wrong stratum and destroys a geological theoryit was enough to blow the party to atoms if in some way it could havebeen published to the world and its significance made knownhe had gone straight on working as soon as he saw what the photographwas and what it meant he had covered it up with another sheet of paperluckily when he unrolled it it had been upsidedown from the point ofview of the telescreenhe took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back his chair so asto get as far away from the telescreen as possible to keep your faceexpressionless was not difficult and even your breathing could becontrolled with an effort but you could not control the beating of yourheart and the telescreen was quite delicate enough to pick it up he letwhat he judged to be ten minutes go by tormented all the while by thefear that some accidenta sudden draught blowing across his desk forinstancewould betray him then without uncovering it again he droppedthe photograph into the memory hole along with some other waste paperswithin another minute perhaps it would have crumbled into ashesthat was teneleven years ago today probably he would have kept thatphotograph it was curious that the fact of having held it in his fingersseemed to him to make a difference even now when the photograph itselfas well as the event it recorded was only memory was the partys holdupon the past less strong he wondered because a piece of evidence whichexisted no longer had once existedbut today supposing that it could be somehow resurrected from its ashesthe photograph might not even be evidence already at the time when hemade his discovery oceania was no longer at war with eurasia and it musthave been to the agents of eastasia that the three dead men had betrayedtheir country since then there had been other changestwo threehe could not remember how many very likely the confessions had beenrewritten and rewritten until the original facts and dates no longerhad the smallest significance the past not only changed but changedcontinuously what most afflicted him with the sense of nightmare was thathe had never clearly understood why the huge imposture was undertakenthe immediate advantages of falsifying the past were obvious but theultimate motive was mysterious he took up his pen again and wrote   i understand how i do not understand whyhe wondered as he had many times wondered before whether he himself wasa lunatic perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one at one time ithad been a sign of madness to believe that the earth goes round the suntoday to believe that the past is unalterable he might be alone inholding that belief and if alone then a lunatic but the thought of beinga lunatic did not greatly trouble him the horror was that he might alsobe wronghe picked up the childrens history book and looked at the portrait ofbig brother which formed its frontispiece the hypnotic eyes gazed intohis own it was as though some huge force were pressing down uponyousomething that penetrated inside your skull battering against yourbrain frightening you out of your beliefs persuading you almost todeny the evidence of your senses in the end the party would announce thattwo and two made five and you would have to believe it it was inevitablethat they should make that claim sooner or later the logic of theirposition demanded it not merely the validity of experience but the veryexistence of external reality was tacitly denied by their philosophy theheresy of heresies was common sense and what was terrifying was not thatthey would kill you for thinking otherwise but that they might be rightfor after all how do we know that two and two make four or that theforce of gravity works or that the past is unchangeable if both the pastand the external world exist only in the mind and if the mind itself iscontrollable what thenbut no his courage seemed suddenly to stiffen of its own accord the faceof obrien not called up by any obvious association had floated into hismind he knew with more certainty than before that obrien was on hisside he was writing the diary for obriento obrien it was like aninterminable letter which no one would ever read but which was addressedto a particular person and took its colour from that factthe party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears it wastheir final most essential command his heart sank as he thought ofthe enormous power arrayed against him the ease with which any partyintellectual would overthrow him in debate the subtle arguments which hewould not be able to understand much less answer and yet he was in theright they were wrong and he was right the obvious the silly and thetrue had got to be defended truisms are true hold on to that the solidworld exists its laws do not change stones are hard water is wetobjects unsupported fall towards the earths centre with the feeling thathe was speaking to obrien and also that he was setting forth an importantaxiom he wrote   freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four if that isgranted all else followschapter from somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of roastingcoffeereal coffee not victory coffeecame floating out into the streetwinston paused involuntarily for perhaps two seconds he was back in thehalfforgotten world of his childhood then a door banged seeming to cutoff the smell as abruptly as though it had been a soundhe had walked several kilometres over pavements and his varicose ulcerwas throbbing this was the second time in three weeks that he had missedan evening at the community centre a rash act since you could be certainthat the number of your attendances at the centre was carefully checkedin principle a party member had no spare time and was never alone exceptin bed it was assumed that when he was not working eating or sleepinghe would be taking part in some kind of communal recreation to do anythingthat suggested a taste for solitude even to go for a walk by yourselfwas always slightly dangerous there was a word for it in newspeakownlife it was called meaning individualism and eccentricity but thisevening as he came out of the ministry the balminess of the april air hadtempted him the sky was a warmer blue than he had seen it that year andsuddenly the long noisy evening at the centre the boring exhaustinggames the lectures the creaking camaraderie oiled by gin had seemedintolerable on impulse he had turned away from the busstop and wanderedoff into the labyrinth of london first south then east then north againlosing himself among unknown streets and hardly bothering in whichdirection he was goingif there is hope he had written in the diary it lies in the prolesthe words kept coming back to him statement of a mystical truth and apalpable absurdity he was somewhere in the vague browncoloured slumsto the north and east of what had once been saint pancras station he waswalking up a cobbled street of little twostorey houses with battereddoorways which gave straight on the pavement and which were somehowcuriously suggestive of ratholes there were puddles of filthy water hereand there among the cobbles in and out of the dark doorways and downnarrow alleyways that branched off on either side people swarmed inastonishing numbersgirls in full bloom with crudely lipsticked mouthsand youths who chased the girls and swollen waddling women who showed youwhat the girls would be like in ten years time and old bent creaturesshuffling along on splayed feet and ragged barefooted children who playedin the puddles and then scattered at angry yells from their mothersperhaps a quarter of the windows in the street were broken and boarded upmost of the people paid no attention to winston a few eyed him with asort of guarded curiosity two monstrous women with brickred forearmsfolded across their aprons were talking outside a doorway winston caughtscraps of conversation as he approachedyes i says to er thats all very well i says but if youd ofbeen in my place youd of done the same as what i done its easy tocriticize i says but you aint got the same problems as what i gotah said the other thats jest it thats jest where it isthe strident voices stopped abruptly the women studied him in hostilesilence as he went past but it was not hostility exactly merely a kindof wariness a momentary stiffening as at the passing of some unfamiliaranimal the blue overalls of the party could not be a common sight in astreet like this indeed it was unwise to be seen in such places unlessyou had definite business there the patrols might stop you if you happenedto run into them may i see your papers comrade what are you doing herewhat time did you leave work is this your usual way homeand so on andso forth not that there was any rule against walking home by an unusualroute but it was enough to draw attention to you if the thought policeheard about itsuddenly the whole street was in commotion there were yells of warningfrom all sides people were shooting into the doorways like rabbits ayoung woman leapt out of a doorway a little ahead of winston grabbed up atiny child playing in a puddle whipped her apron round it and leapt backagain all in one movement at the same instant a man in a concertinalikeblack suit who had emerged from a side alley ran towards winstonpointing excitedly to the skysteamer he yelled look out guvnor bang overead lay down quicksteamer was a nickname which for some reason the proles applied torocket bombs winston promptly flung himself on his face the proles werenearly always right when they gave you a warning of this kind they seemedto possess some kind of instinct which told them several seconds in advancewhen a rocket was coming although the rockets supposedly travelled fasterthan sound winston clasped his forearms above his head there was a roarthat seemed to make the pavement heave a shower of light objects patteredon to his back when he stood up he found that he was covered withfragments of glass from the nearest windowhe walked on the bomb had demolished a group of houses  metres up thestreet a black plume of smoke hung in the sky and below it a cloud ofplaster dust in which a crowd was already forming around the ruins therewas a little pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him and inthe middle of it he could see a bright red streak when he got up to it hesaw that it was a human hand severed at the wrist apart from the bloodystump the hand was so completely whitened as to resemble a plaster casthe kicked the thing into the gutter and then to avoid the crowd turneddown a sidestreet to the right within three or four minutes he was outof the area which the bomb had affected and the sordid swarming life ofthe streets was going on as though nothing had happened it was nearlytwenty hours and the drinkingshops which the proles frequented pubsthey called them were choked with customers from their grimy swing doorsendlessly opening and shutting there came forth a smell of urine sawdustand sour beer in an angle formed by a projecting housefront three menwere standing very close together the middle one of them holding afoldedup newspaper which the other two were studying over his shouldereven before he was near enough to make out the expression on their faceswinston could see absorption in every line of their bodies it wasobviously some serious piece of news that they were reading he was a fewpaces away from them when suddenly the group broke up and two of the menwere in violent altercation for a moment they seemed almost on the pointof blowscant you bleeding well listen to what i say i tell you no number endingin seven aint won for over fourteen monthsyes it as thenno it as not back ome i got the ole lot of em for over two yearswrote down on a piece of paper i takes em down reglar as the clock ani tell you no number ending in sevenyes a seven as won i could pretty near tell you the bleeding numberfour oh seven it ended in it were in februarysecond week in februaryfebruary your grandmother i got it all down in black and white an itell you no numberoh pack it in said the third manthey were talking about the lottery winston looked back when he had gonethirty metres they were still arguing with vivid passionate facesthe lottery with its weekly payout of enormous prizes was the one publicevent to which the proles paid serious attention it was probable thatthere were some millions of proles for whom the lottery was the principalif not the only reason for remaining alive it was their delight theirfolly their anodyne their intellectual stimulant where the lottery wasconcerned even people who could barely read and write seemed capable ofintricate calculations and staggering feats of memory there was a wholetribe of men who made a living simply by selling systems forecasts andlucky amulets winston had nothing to do with the running of the lotterywhich was managed by the ministry of plenty but he was aware indeedeveryone in the party was aware that the prizes were largely imaginaryonly small sums were actually paid out the winners of the big prizes beingnonexistent persons in the absence of any real intercommunication betweenone part of oceania and another this was not difficult to arrangebut if there was hope it lay in the proles you had to cling on to thatwhen you put it in words it sounded reasonable it was when you looked atthe human beings passing you on the pavement that it became an act offaith the street into which he had turned ran downhill he had a feelingthat he had been in this neighbourhood before and that there was a mainthoroughfare not far away from somewhere ahead there came a din ofshouting voices the street took a sharp turn and then ended in a flightof steps which led down into a sunken alley where a few stallkeeperswere selling tiredlooking vegetables at this moment winston rememberedwhere he was the alley led out into the main street and down the nextturning not five minutes away was the junkshop where he had bought theblank book which was now his diary and in a small stationers shop notfar away he had bought his penholder and his bottle of inkhe paused for a moment at the top of the steps on the opposite side ofthe alley there was a dingy little pub whose windows appeared to be frostedover but in reality were merely coated with dust a very old man bent butactive with white moustaches that bristled forward like those of a prawnpushed open the swing door and went in as winston stood watching itoccurred to him that the old man who must be eighty at the least hadalready been middleaged when the revolution happened he and a few otherslike him were the last links that now existed with the vanished world ofcapitalism in the party itself there were not many people left whose ideashad been formed before the revolution the older generation had mostlybeen wiped out in the great purges of the fifties and sixties and the fewwho survived had long ago been terrified into complete intellectualsurrender if there was any one still alive who could give you a truthfulaccount of conditions in the early part of the century it could only be aprole suddenly the passage from the history book that he had copied intohis diary came back into winstons mind and a lunatic impulse took holdof him he would go into the pub he would scrape acquaintance with thatold man and question him he would say to him tell me about your lifewhen you were a boy what was it like in those days were things betterthan they are now or were they worsehurriedly lest he should have time to become frightened he descended thesteps and crossed the narrow street it was madness of course as usualthere was no definite rule against talking to proles and frequenting theirpubs but it was far too unusual an action to pass unnoticed if thepatrols appeared he might plead an attack of faintness but it was notlikely that they would believe him he pushed open the door and a hideouscheesy smell of sour beer hit him in the face as he entered the din ofvoices dropped to about half its volume behind his back he could feeleveryone eyeing his blue overalls a game of darts which was going on atthe other end of the room interrupted itself for perhaps as much as thirtyseconds the old man whom he had followed was standing at the bar havingsome kind of altercation with the barman a large stout hooknosed youngman with enormous forearms a knot of others standing round with glassesin their hands were watching the scenei arst you civil enough didnt i said the old man straightening hisshoulders pugnaciously you telling me you aint got a pint mug in theole bleeding boozerand what in hells name is a pint said the barman leaning forward withthe tips of his fingers on the counterark at im calls isself a barman and dont know what a pint is whya pints the alf of a quart and theres four quarts to the gallonave to teach you the a b c nextnever heard of em said the barman shortly litre and halflitrethats all we serve theres the glasses on the shelf in frontof youi likes a pint persisted the old man you could a drawed me off a pinteasy enough we didnt ave these bleeding litres when i was a young manwhen you were a young man we were all living in the treetops said thebarman with a glance at the other customersthere was a shout of laughter and the uneasiness caused by winstons entryseemed to disappear the old mans whitestubbled face had flushed pink heturned away muttering to himself and bumped into winston winston caughthim gently by the armmay i offer you a drink he saidyoure a gent said the other straightening his shoulders again heappeared not to have noticed winstons blue overalls pint he addedaggressively to the barman pint of wallopthe barman swished two halflitres of darkbrown beer into thick glasseswhich he had rinsed in a bucket under the counter beer was the only drinkyou could get in prole pubs the proles were supposed not to drink ginthough in practice they could get hold of it easily enough the game ofdarts was in full swing again and the knot of men at the bar had beguntalking about lottery tickets winstons presence was forgotten for amoment there was a deal table under the window where he and the old mancould talk without fear of being overheard it was horribly dangerous butat any rate there was no telescreen in the room a point he had made sureof as soon as he came ine could a drawed me off a pint grumbled the old man as he settled downbehind a glass a alf litre aint enough it dont satisfy and a olelitres too much it starts my bladder running let alone the priceyou must have seen great changes since you were a young man saidwinston tentativelythe old mans pale blue eyes moved from the darts board to the bar andfrom the bar to the door of the gents as though it were in the barroomthat he expected the changes to have occurredthe beer was better he said finally and cheaper when i was a youngman mild beerwallop we used to call itwas fourpence a pint that wasbefore the war of coursewhich war was that said winstonits all wars said the old man vaguely he took up his glass and hisshoulders straightened again eres wishing you the very best of ealthin his lean throat the sharppointed adams apple made a surprisingly rapidupanddown movement and the beer vanished winston went to the bar andcame back with two more halflitres the old man appeared to have forgottenhis prejudice against drinking a full litreyou are very much older than i am said winston you must have been agrown man before i was born you can remember what it was like in the olddays before the revolution people of my age dont really know anythingabout those times we can only read about them in books and what it saysin the books may not be true i should like your opinion on that thehistory books say that life before the revolution was completely differentfrom what it is now there was the most terrible oppression injusticepoverty worse than anything we can imagine here in london the great massof the people never had enough to eat from birth to death half of themhadnt even boots on their feet they worked twelve hours a day they leftschool at nine they slept ten in a room and at the same time there werea very few people only a few thousandsthe capitalists they werecalledwho were rich and powerful they owned everything that there wasto own they lived in great gorgeous houses with thirty servants theyrode about in motorcars and fourhorse carriages they drank champagnethey wore top hatsthe old man brightened suddenlytop ats he said funny you should mention em the same thing comeinto my ead only yesterday i dono why i was jest thinking i aint seena top at in years gorn right out they ave the last time i wore onewas at my sisterinlaws funeral and that waswell i couldnt give youthe date but it musta been fifty years ago of course it was only iredfor the occasion you understandit isnt very important about the top hats said winston patientlythe point is these capitaliststhey and a few lawyers and priests andso forth who lived on themwere the lords of the earth everything existedfor their benefit youthe ordinary people the workerswere theirslaves they could do what they liked with you they could ship you off tocanada like cattle they could sleep with your daughters if they chosethey could order you to be flogged with something called a catoninetails you had to take your cap off when you passed them every capitalistwent about with a gang of lackeys whothe old man brightened againlackeys he said now theres a word i aint eard since ever so longlackeys that reglar takes me back that does i recollectoh donkeysyears agoi used to sometimes go to yde park of a sunday afternoon toear the blokes making speeches salvation army roman catholics jewsindiansall sorts there was and there was one blokewell i couldntgive you is name but a real powerful speaker e was e didnt alfgive it em lackeys e says lackeys of the bourgeoisie flunkies ofthe ruling class parasitesthat was another of them and yenasedefinitely called em yenas of course e was referring to the labourparty you understandwinston had the feeling that they were talking at crosspurposeswhat i really wanted to know was this he said do you feel that youhave more freedom now than you had in those days are you treated morelike a human being in the old days the rich people the people at thetopthe ouse of lords put in the old man reminiscentlythe house of lords if you like what i am asking is were these peopleable to treat you as an inferior simply because they were rich and youwere poor is it a fact for instance that you had to call them sir andtake off your cap when you passed themthe old man appeared to think deeply he drank off about a quarter of hisbeer before answeringyes he said they liked you to touch your cap to em it showedrespect like i didnt agree with it myself but i done it often enoughhad to as you might sayand was it usualim only quoting what ive read in history bookswasit usual for these people and their servants to push you off the pavementinto the gutterone of em pushed me once said the old man i recollect it as if itwas yesterday it was boat race nightterribly rowdy they used to get onboat race nightand i bumps into a young bloke on shaftesbury avenuequite a gent e wasdress shirt top at black overcoat e was kindof zigzagging across the pavement and i bumps into im accidentallikee says why cant you look where youre going e says i say ju thinkyouve bought the bleeding pavement e says ill twist your bloody eadoff if you get fresh with me i says youre drunk ill give you incharge in alf a minute i says an if youll believe me e puts isand on my chest and gives me a shove as pretty near sent me under thewheels of a bus well i was young in them days and i was going to avefetched im one onlya sense of helplessness took hold of winston the old mans memory wasnothing but a rubbishheap of details one could question him all daywithout getting any real information the party histories might still betrue after a fashion they might even be completely true he made a lastattemptperhaps i have not made myself clear he said what im trying to sayis this you have been alive a very long time you lived half your lifebefore the revolution in  for instance you were already grown upwould you say from what you can remember that life in  was betterthan it is now or worse if you could choose would you prefer to livethen or nowthe old man looked meditatively at the darts board he finished up hisbeer more slowly than before when he spoke it was with a tolerantphilosophical air as though the beer had mellowed himi know what you expect me to say he said you expect me to say as idsooner be young again most peopled say theyd sooner be young if youarst em you got your ealth and strength when youre young when youget to my time of life you aint never well i suffer something wickedfrom my feet and my bladders jest terrible six and seven times a nightit as me out of bed on the other and theres great advantages in beinga old man you aint got the same worries no truck with women and thatsa great thing i aint ad a woman for near on thirty year if youdcredit it nor wanted to whats morewinston sat back against the windowsill it was no use going on he wasabout to buy some more beer when the old man suddenly got up and shuffledrapidly into the stinking urinal at the side of the room the extrahalflitre was already working on him winston sat for a minute or twogazing at his empty glass and hardly noticed when his feet carried him outinto the street again within twenty years at the most he reflected thehuge and simple question was life better before the revolution than itis now would have ceased once and for all to be answerable but in effectit was unanswerable even now since the few scattered survivors from theancient world were incapable of comparing one age with another theyremembered a million useless things a quarrel with a workmate a hunt fora lost bicycle pump the expression on a longdead sisters face theswirls of dust on a windy morning seventy years ago but all the relevantfacts were outside the range of their vision they were like the antwhich can see small objects but not large ones and when memory failed andwritten records were falsifiedwhen that happened the claim of the partyto have improved the conditions of human life had got to be acceptedbecause there did not exist and never again could exist any standardagainst which it could be testedat this moment his train of thought stopped abruptly he halted and lookedup he was in a narrow street with a few dark little shops interspersedamong dwellinghouses immediately above his head there hung threediscoloured metal balls which looked as if they had once been gilded heseemed to know the place of course he was standing outside the junkshopwhere he had bought the diarya twinge of fear went through him it had been a sufficiently rash act tobuy the book in the beginning and he had sworn never to come near theplace again and yet the instant that he allowed his thoughts to wanderhis feet had brought him back here of their own accord it was preciselyagainst suicidal impulses of this kind that he had hoped to guard himselfby opening the diary at the same time he noticed that although it wasnearly twentyone hours the shop was still open with the feeling that hewould be less conspicuous inside than hanging about on the pavement hestepped through the doorway if questioned he could plausibly say thathe was trying to buy razor bladesthe proprietor had just lighted a hanging oil lamp which gave off anunclean but friendly smell he was a man of perhaps sixty frail andbowed with a long benevolent nose and mild eyes distorted by thickspectacles his hair was almost white but his eyebrows were bushy andstill black his spectacles his gentle fussy movements and the factthat he was wearing an aged jacket of black velvet gave him a vague airof intellectuality as though he had been some kind of literary man orperhaps a musician his voice was soft as though faded and his accentless debased than that of the majority of prolesi recognized you on the pavement he said immediately youre thegentleman that bought the young ladys keepsake album that was a beautifulbit of paper that was creamlaid it used to be called theres been nopaper like that made foroh i dare say fifty years he peered at winstonover the top of his spectacles is there anything special i can do foryou or did you just want to look roundi was passing said winston vaguely i just looked in i dont wantanything in particularits just as well said the other because i dont suppose i could havesatisfied you he made an apologetic gesture with his softpalmed handyou see how it is an empty shop you might say between you and me theantique trades just about finished no demand any longer and no stockeither furniture china glass its all been broken up by degrees andof course the metal stuffs mostly been melted down i havent seen a brasscandlestick in yearsthe tiny interior of the shop was in fact uncomfortably full but therewas almost nothing in it of the slightest value the floorspace was veryrestricted because all round the walls were stacked innumerable dustypictureframes in the window there were trays of nuts and bolts wornoutchisels penknives with broken blades tarnished watches that did not evenpretend to be in going order and other miscellaneous rubbish only on asmall table in the corner was there a litter of odds and endslacqueredsnuffboxes agate brooches and the likewhich looked as though they mightinclude something interesting as winston wandered towards the table hiseye was caught by a round smooth thing that gleamed softly in thelamplight and he picked it upit was a heavy lump of glass curved on one side flat on the other makingalmost a hemisphere there was a peculiar softness as of rainwater inboth the colour and the texture of the glass at the heart of it magnifiedby the curved surface there was a strange pink convoluted object thatrecalled a rose or a sea anemonewhat is it said winston fascinatedthats coral that is said the old man it must have come from theindian ocean they used to kind of embed it in the glass that wasnt madeless than a hundred years ago more by the look of itits a beautiful thing said winstonit is a beautiful thing said the other appreciatively but theres notmany thatd say so nowadays he coughed now if it so happened that youwanted to buy it thatd cost you four dollars i can remember when a thinglike that would have fetched eight pounds and eight pounds waswell icant work it out but it was a lot of money but who cares about genuineantiques nowadayseven the few thats leftwinston immediately paid over the four dollars and slid the coveted thinginto his pocket what appealed to him about it was not so much its beautyas the air it seemed to possess of belonging to an age quite differentfrom the present one the soft rainwatery glass was not like any glassthat he had ever seen the thing was doubly attractive because of itsapparent uselessness though he could guess that it must once have beenintended as a paperweight it was very heavy in his pocket but fortunatelyit did not make much of a bulge it was a queer thing even a compromisingthing for a party member to have in his possession anything old and forthat matter anything beautiful was always vaguely suspect the old man hadgrown noticeably more cheerful after receiving the four dollars winstonrealized that he would have accepted three or even twotheres another room upstairs that you might care to take a look at hesaid theres not much in it just a few pieces well do with a light ifwere going upstairshe lit another lamp and with bowed back led the way slowly up thesteep and worn stairs and along a tiny passage into a room which didnot give on the street but looked out on a cobbled yard and a forest ofchimneypots winston noticed that the furniture was still arranged asthough the room were meant to be lived in there was a strip of carpet onthe floor a picture or two on the walls and a deep slatternly armchairdrawn up to the fireplace an oldfashioned glass clock with a twelvehourface was ticking away on the mantelpiece under the window and occupyingnearly a quarter of the room was an enormous bed with the mattress stillon itwe lived here till my wife died said the old man half apologeticallyim selling the furniture off by little and little now thats a beautifulmahogany bed or at least it would be if you could get the bugs out of itbut i dare say youd find it a little bit cumbersomehe was holding the lamp high up so as to illuminate the whole room andin the warm dim light the place looked curiously inviting the thoughtflitted through winstons mind that it would probably be quite easy torent the room for a few dollars a week if he dared to take the risk itwas a wild impossible notion to be abandoned as soon as thought of butthe room had awakened in him a sort of nostalgia a sort of ancestralmemory it seemed to him that he knew exactly what it felt like to sit ina room like this in an armchair beside an open fire with your feet inthe fender and a kettle on the hob utterly alone utterly secure withnobody watching you no voice pursuing you no sound except the singingof the kettle and the friendly ticking of the clocktheres no telescreen he could not help murmuringah said the old man i never had one of those things too expensiveand i never seemed to feel the need of it somehow now thats a nicegateleg table in the corner there though of course youd have to put newhinges on it if you wanted to use the flapsthere was a small bookcase in the other corner and winston had alreadygravitated towards it it contained nothing but rubbish the huntingdownand destruction of books had been done with the same thoroughness in theprole quarters as everywhere else it was very unlikely that there existedanywhere in oceania a copy of a book printed earlier than  the oldman still carrying the lamp was standing in front of a picture in arosewood frame which hung on the other side of the fireplace oppositethe bednow if you happen to be interested in old prints at all he begandelicatelywinston came across to examine the picture it was a steel engraving of anoval building with rectangular windows and a small tower in front therewas a railing running round the building and at the rear end there waswhat appeared to be a statue winston gazed at it for some moments itseemed vaguely familiar though he did not remember the statuethe frames fixed to the wall said the old man but i could unscrew itfor you i dare sayi know that building said winston finally its a ruin now its inthe middle of the street outside the palace of justicethats right outside the law courts it was bombed inoh many yearsago it was a church at one time st clement danes its name was hesmiled apologetically as though conscious of saying something slightlyridiculous and added oranges and lemons say the bells of st clementswhats that said winstonohoranges and lemons say the bells of st clements that was a rhymewe had when i was a little boy how it goes on i dont remember but i doknow it ended up here comes a candle to light you to bed here comes achopper to chop off your head it was a kind of a dance they held outtheir arms for you to pass under and when they came to here comes achopper to chop off your head they brought their arms down and caught youit was just names of churches all the london churches were in itall theprincipal ones that iswinston wondered vaguely to what century the church belonged it was alwaysdifficult to determine the age of a london building anything large andimpressive if it was reasonably new in appearance was automaticallyclaimed as having been built since the revolution while anything that wasobviously of earlier date was ascribed to some dim period called the middleages the centuries of capitalism were held to have produced nothing of anyvalue one could not learn history from architecture any more than onecould learn it from books statues inscriptions memorial stones thenames of streetsanything that might throw light upon the past had beensystematically alteredi never knew it had been a church he saidtheres a lot of them left really said the old man though theyvebeen put to other uses now how did that rhyme go ah ive got it  oranges and lemons say the bells of st clements  you owe me three farthings say the bells of st martinsthere now thats as far as i can get a farthing that was a small coppercoin looked something like a centwhere was st martins said winstonst martins thats still standing its in victory square alongside thepicture gallery a building with a kind of a triangular porch and pillarsin front and a big flight of stepswinston knew the place well it was a museum used for propaganda displaysof various kindsscale models of rocket bombs and floating fortresseswaxwork tableaux illustrating enemy atrocities and the likest martinsinthefields it used to be called supplemented the old manthough i dont recollect any fields anywhere in those partswinston did not buy the picture it would have been an even moreincongruous possession than the glass paperweight and impossible to carryhome unless it were taken out of its frame but he lingered for someminutes more talking to the old man whose name he discovered was notweeksas one might have gathered from the inscription over theshopfrontbut charrington mr charrington it seemed was a widower agedsixtythree and had inhabited this shop for thirty years throughout thattime he had been intending to alter the name over the window but had neverquite got to the point of doing it all the while that they were talkingthe halfremembered rhyme kept running through winstons head oranges andlemons say the bells of st clements you owe me three farthings saythe bells of st martins it was curious but when you said it to yourselfyou had the illusion of actually hearing bells the bells of a lost londonthat still existed somewhere or other disguised and forgotten from oneghostly steeple after another he seemed to hear them pealing forth yet sofar as he could remember he had never in real life heard church bellsringinghe got away from mr charrington and went down the stairs alone so as notto let the old man see him reconnoitring the street before stepping out ofthe door he had already made up his mind that after a suitableintervala month sayhe would take the risk of visiting the shop againit was perhaps not more dangerous than shirking an evening at the centrethe serious piece of folly had been to come back here in the first placeafter buying the diary and without knowing whether the proprietor of theshop could be trusted howeveryes he thought again he would come back he would buy further scraps ofbeautiful rubbish he would buy the engraving of st clement danes takeit out of its frame and carry it home concealed under the jacket of hisoveralls he would drag the rest of that poem out of mr charringtonsmemory even the lunatic project of renting the room upstairs flashedmomentarily through his mind again for perhaps five seconds exaltationmade him careless and he stepped out on to the pavement without so muchas a preliminary glance through the window he had even started hummingto an improvised tune  oranges and lemons say the bells of st clements  you owe me three farthings say thesuddenly his heart seemed to turn to ice and his bowels to water a figurein blue overalls was coming down the pavement not ten metres away it wasthe girl from the fiction department the girl with dark hair the lightwas failing but there was no difficulty in recognizing her she lookedhim straight in the face then walked quickly on as though she had notseen himfor a few seconds winston was too paralysed to move then he turned to theright and walked heavily away not noticing for the moment that he wasgoing in the wrong direction at any rate one question was settled therewas no doubting any longer that the girl was spying on him she must havefollowed him here because it was not credible that by pure chance sheshould have happened to be walking on the same evening up the same obscurebackstreet kilometres distant from any quarter where party members livedit was too great a coincidence whether she was really an agent of thethought police or simply an amateur spy actuated by officiousness hardlymattered it was enough that she was watching him probably she had seenhim go into the pub as wellit was an effort to walk the lump of glass in his pocket banged againsthis thigh at each step and he was half minded to take it out and throw itaway the worst thing was the pain in his belly for a couple of minuteshe had the feeling that he would die if he did not reach a lavatory soonbut there would be no public lavatories in a quarter like this then thespasm passed leaving a dull ache behindthe street was a blind alley winston halted stood for several secondswondering vaguely what to do then turned round and began to retrace hissteps as he turned it occurred to him that the girl had only passed himthree minutes ago and that by running he could probably catch up with herhe could keep on her track till they were in some quiet place and thensmash her skull in with a cobblestone the piece of glass in his pocketwould be heavy enough for the job but he abandoned the idea immediatelybecause even the thought of making any physical effort was unbearable hecould not run he could not strike a blow besides she was young and lustyand would defend herself he thought also of hurrying to the communitycentre and staying there till the place closed so as to establish apartial alibi for the evening but that too was impossible a deadlylassitude had taken hold of him all he wanted was to get home quickly andthen sit down and be quietit was after twentytwo hours when he got back to the flat the lightswould be switched off at the main at twentythree thirty he went into thekitchen and swallowed nearly a teacupful of victory gin then he went tothe table in the alcove sat down and took the diary out of the drawerbut he did not open it at once from the telescreen a brassy female voicewas squalling a patriotic song he sat staring at the marbled cover of thebook trying without success to shut the voice out of his consciousnessit was at night that they came for you always at night the proper thingwas to kill yourself before they got you undoubtedly some people did somany of the disappearances were actually suicides but it needed desperatecourage to kill yourself in a world where firearms or any quick andcertain poison were completely unprocurable he thought with a kind ofastonishment of the biological uselessness of pain and fear the treacheryof the human body which always freezes into inertia at exactly the momentwhen a special effort is needed he might have silenced the darkhairedgirl if only he had acted quickly enough but precisely because of theextremity of his danger he had lost the power to act it struck him thatin moments of crisis one is never fighting against an external enemy butalways against ones own body even now in spite of the gin the dullache in his belly made consecutive thought impossible and it is the samehe perceived in all seemingly heroic or tragic situations on thebattlefield in the torture chamber on a sinking ship the issues thatyou are fighting for are always forgotten because the body swells up untilit fills the universe and even when you are not paralysed by fright orscreaming with pain life is a momenttomoment struggle against hunger orcold or sleeplessness against a sour stomach or an aching toothhe opened the diary it was important to write something down the womanon the telescreen had started a new song her voice seemed to stick intohis brain like jagged splinters of glass he tried to think of obrienfor whom or to whom the diary was written but instead he began thinkingof the things that would happen to him after the thought police took himaway it would not matter if they killed you at once to be killed waswhat you expected but before death nobody spoke of such things yeteverybody knew of them there was the routine of confession that had tobe gone through the grovelling on the floor and screaming for mercy thecrack of broken bones the smashed teeth and bloody clots of hairwhy did you have to endure it since the end was always the same why wasit not possible to cut a few days or weeks out of your life nobody everescaped detection and nobody ever failed to confess when once you hadsuccumbed to thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given date you would bedead why then did that horror which altered nothing have to lie embeddedin future timehe tried with a little more success than before to summon up the image ofobrien we shall meet in the place where there is no darkness obrienhad said to him he knew what it meant or thought he knew the place wherethere is no darkness was the imagined future which one would never seebut which by foreknowledge one could mystically share in but with thevoice from the telescreen nagging at his ears he could not follow the trainof thought further he put a cigarette in his mouth half the tobaccopromptly fell out on to his tongue a bitter dust which was difficult tospit out again the face of big brother swam into his mind displacing thatof obrien just as he had done a few days earlier he slid a coin out ofhis pocket and looked at it the face gazed up at him heavy calmprotecting but what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustachelike a leaden knell the words came back at him  war is peace  freedom is slavery  ignorance is strengthpart twochapter it was the middle of the morning and winston had left the cubicle to goto the lavatorya solitary figure was coming towards him from the other end of the longbrightlylit corridor it was the girl with dark hair four days had gonepast since the evening when he had run into her outside the junkshopas she came nearer he saw that her right arm was in a sling not noticeableat a distance because it was of the same colour as her overalls probablyshe had crushed her hand while swinging round one of the big kaleidoscopeson which the plots of novels were roughed in it was a common accidentin the fiction departmentthey were perhaps four metres apart when the girl stumbled and fell almostflat on her face a sharp cry of pain was wrung out of her she must havefallen right on the injured arm winston stopped short the girl had risento her knees her face had turned a milky yellow colour against which hermouth stood out redder than ever her eyes were fixed on his with anappealing expression that looked more like fear than paina curious emotion stirred in winstons heart in front of him was an enemywho was trying to kill him in front of him also was a human creaturein pain and perhaps with a broken bone already he had instinctivelystarted forward to help her in the moment when he had seen her fall onthe bandaged arm it had been as though he felt the pain in his own bodyyoure hurt he saidits nothing my arm itll be all right in a secondshe spoke as though her heart were fluttering she had certainly turnedvery paleyou havent broken anythingno im all right it hurt for a moment thats allshe held out her free hand to him and he helped her up she had regainedsome of her colour and appeared very much betterits nothing she repeated shortly i only gave my wrist a bit of abang thanks comradeand with that she walked on in the direction in which she had been goingas briskly as though it had really been nothing the whole incident couldnot have taken as much as half a minute not to let ones feelings appearin ones face was a habit that had acquired the status of an instinctand in any case they had been standing straight in front of a telescreenwhen the thing happened nevertheless it had been very difficult not tobetray a momentary surprise for in the two or three seconds while he washelping her up the girl had slipped something into his hand there was noquestion that she had done it intentionally it was something small andflat as he passed through the lavatory door he transferred it to hispocket and felt it with the tips of his fingers it was a scrap of paperfolded into a squarewhile he stood at the urinal he managed with a little more fingering toget it unfolded obviously there must be a message of some kind written onit for a moment he was tempted to take it into one of the waterclosetsand read it at once but that would be shocking folly as he well knewthere was no place where you could be more certain that the telescreenswere watched continuouslyhe went back to his cubicle sat down threw the fragment of papercasually among the other papers on the desk put on his spectacles andhitched the speakwrite towards him five minutes he told himselffive minutes at the very least his heart bumped in his breast withfrightening loudness fortunately the piece of work he was engaged on wasmere routine the rectification of a long list of figures not needingclose attentionwhatever was written on the paper it must have some kind of politicalmeaning so far as he could see there were two possibilities one muchthe more likely was that the girl was an agent of the thought policejust as he had feared he did not know why the thought police shouldchoose to deliver their messages in such a fashion but perhaps they hadtheir reasons the thing that was written on the paper might be a threat asummons an order to commit suicide a trap of some description but therewas another wilder possibility that kept raising its head though hetried vainly to suppress it this was that the message did not come fromthe thought police at all but from some kind of underground organizationperhaps the brotherhood existed after all perhaps the girl was part of itno doubt the idea was absurd but it had sprung into his mind in the veryinstant of feeling the scrap of paper in his hand it was not till a coupleof minutes later that the other more probable explanation had occurred tohim and even now though his intellect told him that the message probablymeant deathstill that was not what he believed and the unreasonablehope persisted and his heart banged and it was with difficulty that hekept his voice from trembling as he murmured his figures into thespeakwritehe rolled up the completed bundle of work and slid it into the pneumatictube eight minutes had gone by he readjusted his spectacles on his nosesighed and drew the next batch of work towards him with the scrap ofpaper on top of it he flattened it out on it was written in a largeunformed handwritingi love youfor several seconds he was too stunned even to throw the incriminatingthing into the memory hole when he did so although he knew very well thedanger of showing too much interest he could not resist reading it onceagain just to make sure that the words were really therefor the rest of the morning it was very difficult to work what was evenworse than having to focus his mind on a series of niggling jobs was theneed to conceal his agitation from the telescreen he felt as though afire were burning in his belly lunch in the hot crowded noisefilledcanteen was torment he had hoped to be alone for a little while duringthe lunch hour but as bad luck would have it the imbecile parsons floppeddown beside him the tang of his sweat almost defeating the tinny smell ofstew and kept up a stream of talk about the preparations for hate weekhe was particularly enthusiastic about a papiermache model of bigbrothers head two metres wide which was being made for the occasion byhis daughters troop of spies the irritating thing was that in the racketof voices winston could hardly hear what parsons was saying and wasconstantly having to ask for some fatuous remark to be repeated just oncehe caught a glimpse of the girl at a table with two other girls at thefar end of the room she appeared not to have seen him and he did notlook in that direction againthe afternoon was more bearable immediately after lunch there arrived adelicate difficult piece of work which would take several hours andnecessitated putting everything else aside it consisted in falsifying aseries of production reports of two years ago in such a way as to castdiscredit on a prominent member of the inner party who was now under acloud this was the kind of thing that winston was good at and for morethan two hours he succeeded in shutting the girl out of his mindaltogether then the memory of her face came back and with it a ragingintolerable desire to be alone until he could be alone it was impossibleto think this new development out tonight was one of his nights at thecommunity centre he wolfed another tasteless meal in the canteen hurriedoff to the centre took part in the solemn foolery of a discussion groupplayed two games of table tennis swallowed several glasses of gin andsat for half an hour through a lecture entitled ingsoc in relation tochess his soul writhed with boredom but for once he had had no impulseto shirk his evening at the centre at the sight of the words i love youthe desire to stay alive had welled up in him and the taking of minorrisks suddenly seemed stupid it was not till twentythree hours when hewas home and in bedin the darkness where you were safe even from thetelescreen so long as you kept silentthat he was able to thinkcontinuouslyit was a physical problem that had to be solved how to get in touch withthe girl and arrange a meeting he did not consider any longer thepossibility that she might be laying some kind of trap for him he knewthat it was not so because of her unmistakable agitation when she handedhim the note obviously she had been frightened out of her wits as wellshe might be nor did the idea of refusing her advances even cross hismind only five nights ago he had contemplated smashing her skull in witha cobblestone but that was of no importance he thought of her nakedyouthful body as he had seen it in his dream he had imagined her a foollike all the rest of them her head stuffed with lies and hatred herbelly full of ice a kind of fever seized him at the thought that he mightlose her the white youthful body might slip away from him what he fearedmore than anything else was that she would simply change her mind if hedid not get in touch with her quickly but the physical difficulty ofmeeting was enormous it was like trying to make a move at chess when youwere already mated whichever way you turned the telescreen faced youactually all the possible ways of communicating with her had occurred tohim within five minutes of reading the note but now with time to thinkhe went over them one by one as though laying out a row of instrumentson a tableobviously the kind of encounter that had happened this morning could notbe repeated if she had worked in the records department it might havebeen comparatively simple but he had only a very dim idea whereabouts inthe building the fiction department lay and he had no pretext for goingthere if he had known where she lived and at what time she left workhe could have contrived to meet her somewhere on her way home but to tryto follow her home was not safe because it would mean loitering aboutoutside the ministry which was bound to be noticed as for sending aletter through the mails it was out of the question by a routine thatwas not even secret all letters were opened in transit actually fewpeople ever wrote letters for the messages that it was occasionallynecessary to send there were printed postcards with long lists of phrasesand you struck out the ones that were inapplicable in any case he did notknow the girls name let alone her address finally he decided that thesafest place was the canteen if he could get her at a table by herselfsomewhere in the middle of the room not too near the telescreens andwith a sufficient buzz of conversation all roundif these conditionsendured for say thirty seconds it might be possible to exchange a fewwordsfor a week after this life was like a restless dream on the next day shedid not appear in the canteen until he was leaving it the whistle havingalready blown presumably she had been changed on to a later shift theypassed each other without a glance on the day after that she was in thecanteen at the usual time but with three other girls and immediatelyunder a telescreen then for three dreadful days she did not appear atall his whole mind and body seemed to be afflicted with an unbearablesensitivity a sort of transparency which made every movement everysound every contact every word that he had to speak or listen to anagony even in sleep he could not altogether escape from her image he didnot touch the diary during those days if there was any relief it was inhis work in which he could sometimes forget himself for ten minutes at astretch he had absolutely no clue as to what had happened to her therewas no enquiry he could make she might have been vaporized she mighthave committed suicide she might have been transferred to the other endof oceania worst and likeliest of all she might simply have changed hermind and decided to avoid himthe next day she reappeared her arm was out of the sling and she had aband of stickingplaster round her wrist the relief of seeing her wasso great that he could not resist staring directly at her for severalseconds on the following day he very nearly succeeded in speaking to herwhen he came into the canteen she was sitting at a table well out from thewall and was quite alone it was early and the place was not very fullthe queue edged forward till winston was almost at the counter then washeld up for two minutes because someone in front was complaining that hehad not received his tablet of saccharine but the girl was still alonewhen winston secured his tray and began to make for her table he walkedcasually towards her his eyes searching for a place at some table beyondher she was perhaps three metres away from him another two seconds woulddo it then a voice behind him called smith he pretended not to hearsmith repeated the voice more loudly it was no use he turned rounda blondheaded sillyfaced young man named wilsher whom he barely knewwas inviting him with a smile to a vacant place at his table it was notsafe to refuse after having been recognized he could not go and sit ata table with an unattended girl it was too noticeable he sat down witha friendly smile the silly blond face beamed into his winston had ahallucination of himself smashing a pickaxe right into the middle of itthe girls table filled up a few minutes laterbut she must have seen him coming towards her and perhaps she would takethe hint next day he took care to arrive early surely enough she was ata table in about the same place and again alone the person immediatelyahead of him in the queue was a small swiftlymoving beetlelike manwith a flat face and tiny suspicious eyes as winston turned away fromthe counter with his tray he saw that the little man was making straightfor the girls table his hopes sank again there was a vacant place at atable further away but something in the little mans appearance suggestedthat he would be sufficiently attentive to his own comfort to choose theemptiest table with ice at his heart winston followed it was no useunless he could get the girl alone at this moment there was a tremendouscrash the little man was sprawling on all fours his tray had gone flyingtwo streams of soup and coffee were flowing across the floor he startedto his feet with a malignant glance at winston whom he evidentlysuspected of having tripped him up but it was all right five secondslater with a thundering heart winston was sitting at the girls tablehe did not look at her he unpacked his tray and promptly began eatingit was allimportant to speak at once before anyone else came but nowa terrible fear had taken possession of him a week had gone by sinceshe had first approached him she would have changed her mind she musthave changed her mind it was impossible that this affair should endsuccessfully such things did not happen in real life he might haveflinched altogether from speaking if at this moment he had not seenampleforth the hairyeared poet wandering limply round the room witha tray looking for a place to sit down in his vague way ampleforthwas attached to winston and would certainly sit down at his table ifhe caught sight of him there was perhaps a minute in which to act bothwinston and the girl were eating steadily the stuff they were eating wasa thin stew actually a soup of haricot beans in a low murmur winstonbegan speaking neither of them looked up steadily they spooned thewatery stuff into their mouths and between spoonfuls exchanged the fewnecessary words in low expressionless voiceswhat time do you leave workeighteenthirtywhere can we meetvictory square near the monumentits full of telescreensit doesnt matter if theres a crowdany signalno dont come up to me until you see me among a lot of people and dontlook at me just keep somewhere near mewhat timenineteen hoursall rightampleforth failed to see winston and sat down at another table they didnot speak again and so far as it was possible for two people sitting onopposite sides of the same table they did not look at one another thegirl finished her lunch quickly and made off while winston stayed tosmoke a cigarettewinston was in victory square before the appointed time he wandered roundthe base of the enormous fluted column at the top of which big brothersstatue gazed southward towards the skies where he had vanquished theeurasian aeroplanes the eastasian aeroplanes it had been a few yearsago in the battle of airstrip one in the street in front of it there wasa statue of a man on horseback which was supposed to represent olivercromwell at five minutes past the hour the girl had still not appearedagain the terrible fear seized upon winston she was not coming she hadchanged her mind he walked slowly up to the north side of the square andgot a sort of palecoloured pleasure from identifying st martins churchwhose bells when it had bells had chimed you owe me three farthingsthen he saw the girl standing at the base of the monument reading orpretending to read a poster which ran spirally up the column it was notsafe to go near her until some more people had accumulated there weretelescreens all round the pediment but at this moment there was a din ofshouting and a zoom of heavy vehicles from somewhere to the left suddenlyeveryone seemed to be running across the square the girl nipped nimblyround the lions at the base of the monument and joined in the rushwinston followed as he ran he gathered from some shouted remarks thata convoy of eurasian prisoners was passingalready a dense mass of people was blocking the south side of the squarewinston at normal times the kind of person who gravitates to the outeredge of any kind of scrimmage shoved butted squirmed his way forwardinto the heart of the crowd soon he was within arms length of the girlbut the way was blocked by an enormous prole and an almost equally enormouswoman presumably his wife who seemed to form an impenetrable wall offlesh winston wriggled himself sideways and with a violent lunge managedto drive his shoulder between them for a moment it felt as though hisentrails were being ground to pulp between the two muscular hips then hehad broken through sweating a little he was next to the girl they wereshoulder to shoulder both staring fixedly in front of thema long line of trucks with woodenfaced guards armed with submachineguns standing upright in each corner was passing slowly down the streetin the trucks little yellow men in shabby greenish uniforms were squattingjammed close together their sad mongolian faces gazed out over the sidesof the trucks utterly incurious occasionally when a truck jolted therewas a clankclank of metal all the prisoners were wearing legironstruckload after truckload of the sad faces passed winston knew theywere there but he saw them only intermittently the girls shoulder andher arm right down to the elbow were pressed against his her cheek wasalmost near enough for him to feel its warmth she had immediately takencharge of the situation just as she had done in the canteen she beganspeaking in the same expressionless voice as before with lips barelymoving a mere murmur easily drowned by the din of voices and the rumblingof the truckscan you hear meyescan you get sunday afternoon offyesthen listen carefully youll have to remember this go to paddingtonstationwith a sort of military precision that astonished him she outlined theroute that he was to follow a halfhour railway journey turn left outsidethe station two kilometres along the road a gate with the top barmissing a path across a field a grassgrown lane a track between bushesa dead tree with moss on it it was as though she had a map inside herhead can you remember all that she murmured finallyyesyou turn left then right then left again and the gates got no top baryes what timeabout fifteen you may have to wait ill get there by another way areyou sure you remember everythingyesthen get away from me as quick as you canshe need not have told him that but for the moment they could notextricate themselves from the crowd the trucks were still filing pastthe people still insatiably gaping at the start there had been a few boosand hisses but it came only from the party members among the crowd andhad soon stopped the prevailing emotion was simply curiosity foreignerswhether from eurasia or from eastasia were a kind of strange animal oneliterally never saw them except in the guise of prisoners and even asprisoners one never got more than a momentary glimpse of them nor didone know what became of them apart from the few who were hanged aswarcriminals the others simply vanished presumably into forcedlabourcamps the round mogol faces had given way to faces of a more europeantype dirty bearded and exhausted from over scrubby cheekbones eyeslooked into winstons sometimes with strange intensity and flashed awayagain the convoy was drawing to an end in the last truck he could see anaged man his face a mass of grizzled hair standing upright with wristscrossed in front of him as though he were used to having them boundtogether it was almost time for winston and the girl to part but at thelast moment while the crowd still hemmed them in her hand felt for hisand gave it a fleeting squeezeit could not have been ten seconds and yet it seemed a long time thattheir hands were clasped together he had time to learn every detailof her hand he explored the long fingers the shapely nails theworkhardened palm with its row of callouses the smooth flesh under thewrist merely from feeling it he would have known it by sight in thesame instant it occurred to him that he did not know what colour thegirls eyes were they were probably brown but people with dark hairsometimes had blue eyes to turn his head and look at her would havebeen inconceivable folly with hands locked together invisible amongthe press of bodies they stared steadily in front of them and insteadof the eyes of the girl the eyes of the aged prisoner gazed mournfullyat winston out of nests of hairchapter winston picked his way up the lane through dappled light and shadestepping out into pools of gold wherever the boughs parted under thetrees to the left of him the ground was misty with bluebells the airseemed to kiss ones skin it was the second of may from somewhere deeperin the heart of the wood came the droning of ringdoveshe was a bit early there had been no difficulties about the journey andthe girl was so evidently experienced that he was less frightened than hewould normally have been presumably she could be trusted to find a safeplace in general you could not assume that you were much safer in thecountry than in london there were no telescreens of course but therewas always the danger of concealed microphones by which your voice mightbe picked up and recognized besides it was not easy to make a journeyby yourself without attracting attention for distances of less than kilometres it was not necessary to get your passport endorsed butsometimes there were patrols hanging about the railway stations whoexamined the papers of any party member they found there and asked awkwardquestions however no patrols had appeared and on the walk from thestation he had made sure by cautious backward glances that he was notbeing followed the train was full of proles in holiday mood because ofthe summery weather the woodenseated carriage in which he travelled wasfilled to overflowing by a single enormous family ranging from a toothlessgreatgrandmother to a monthold baby going out to spend an afternoonwith inlaws in the country and as they freely explained to winstonto get hold of a little blackmarket butterthe lane widened and in a minute he came to the footpath she had told himof a mere cattletrack which plunged between the bushes he had no watchbut it could not be fifteen yet the bluebells were so thick underfootthat it was impossible not to tread on them he knelt down and beganpicking some partly to pass the time away but also from a vague idea thathe would like to have a bunch of flowers to offer to the girl when theymet he had got together a big bunch and was smelling their faint sicklyscent when a sound at his back froze him the unmistakable crackle of afoot on twigs he went on picking bluebells it was the best thing to doit might be the girl or he might have been followed after all to lookround was to show guilt he picked another and another a hand felllightly on his shoulderhe looked up it was the girl she shook her head evidently as a warningthat he must keep silent then parted the bushes and quickly led the wayalong the narrow track into the wood obviously she had been that waybefore for she dodged the boggy bits as though by habit winston followedstill clasping his bunch of flowers his first feeling was relief but ashe watched the strong slender body moving in front of him with the scarletsash that was just tight enough to bring out the curve of her hips thesense of his own inferiority was heavy upon him even now it seemed quitelikely that when she turned round and looked at him she would draw backafter all the sweetness of the air and the greenness of the leaves dauntedhim already on the walk from the station the may sunshine had made himfeel dirty and etiolated a creature of indoors with the sooty dust oflondon in the pores of his skin it occurred to him that till now she hadprobably never seen him in broad daylight in the open they came to thefallen tree that she had spoken of the girl hopped over and forced apartthe bushes in which there did not seem to be an opening when winstonfollowed her he found that they were in a natural clearing a tiny grassyknoll surrounded by tall saplings that shut it in completely the girlstopped and turnedhere we are she saidhe was facing her at several paces distance as yet he did not dare movenearer to heri didnt want to say anything in the lane she went on in case theresa mike hidden there i dont suppose there is but there could be theresalways the chance of one of those swine recognizing your voice were allright herehe still had not the courage to approach her were all right herehe repeated stupidlyyes look at the trees they were small ashes which at some time hadbeen cut down and had sprouted up again into a forest of poles none ofthem thicker than ones wrist theres nothing big enough to hide a mikein besides ive been here beforethey were only making conversation he had managed to move closer to hernow she stood before him very upright with a smile on her face thatlooked faintly ironical as though she were wondering why he was so slowto act the bluebells had cascaded on to the ground they seemed to havefallen of their own accord he took her handwould you believe he said that till this moment i didnt know whatcolour your eyes were they were brown he noted a rather light shade ofbrown with dark lashes now that youve seen what im really likecan you still bear to look at meyes easilyim thirtynine years old ive got a wife that i cant get rid of ivegot varicose veins ive got five false teethi couldnt care less said the girlthe next moment it was hard to say by whose act she was in his armsat the beginning he had no feeling except sheer incredulity the youthfulbody was strained against his own the mass of dark hair was against hisface and yes actually she had turned her face up and he was kissing thewide red mouth she had clasped her arms about his neck she was callinghim darling precious one loved one he had pulled her down on to theground she was utterly unresisting he could do what he liked with herbut the truth was that he had no physical sensation except that of merecontact all he felt was incredulity and pride he was glad that this washappening but he had no physical desire it was too soon her youth andprettiness had frightened him he was too much used to living withoutwomenhe did not know the reason the girl picked herself up and pulled abluebell out of her hair she sat against him putting her arm round hiswaistnever mind dear theres no hurry weve got the whole afternoon isntthis a splendid hideout i found it when i got lost once on a communityhike if anyone was coming you could hear them a hundred metres awaywhat is your name said winstonjulia i know yours its winstonwinston smithhow did you find that outi expect im better at finding things out than you are dear tell mewhat did you think of me before that day i gave you the notehe did not feel any temptation to tell lies to her it was even a sort ofloveoffering to start off by telling the worsti hated the sight of you he said i wanted to rape you and then murderyou afterwards two weeks ago i thought seriously of smashing your head inwith a cobblestone if you really want to know i imagined that you hadsomething to do with the thought policethe girl laughed delightedly evidently taking this as atribute to the excellence of her disguisenot the thought police you didnt honestly think thatwell perhaps not exactly that but from your general appearancemerelybecause youre young and fresh and healthy you understandi thought thatprobablyyou thought i was a good party member pure in word and deed bannersprocessions slogans games community hikes all that stuff and youthought that if i had a quarter of a chance id denounce you as athoughtcriminal and get you killed offyes something of that kind a great many young girls are like thatyou knowits this bloody thing that does it she said ripping off the scarletsash of the junior antisex league and flinging it on to a bough thenas though touching her waist had reminded her of something she felt inthe pocket of her overalls and produced a small slab of chocolate shebroke it in half and gave one of the pieces to winston even before he hadtaken it he knew by the smell that it was very unusual chocolate it wasdark and shiny and was wrapped in silver paper chocolate normally wasdullbrown crumbly stuff that tasted as nearly as one could describe itlike the smoke of a rubbish fire but at some time or another he had tastedchocolate like the piece she had given him the first whiff of its scenthad stirred up some memory which he could not pin down but which waspowerful and troublingwhere did you get this stuff he saidblack market she said indifferently actually i am that sort of girlto look at im good at games i was a troopleader in the spies i dovoluntary work three evenings a week for the junior antisex league hoursand hours ive spent pasting their bloody rot all over london i alwayscarry one end of a banner in the processions i always look cheerful andi never shirk anything always yell with the crowd thats what i sayits the only way to be safethe first fragment of chocolate had melted on winstons tongue the tastewas delightful but there was still that memory moving round the edges ofhis consciousness something strongly felt but not reducible to definiteshape like an object seen out of the corner of ones eye he pushed itaway from him aware only that it was the memory of some action which hewould have liked to undo but could notyou are very young he said you are ten or fifteen years younger thani am what could you see to attract you in a man like meit was something in your face i thought id take a chance im good atspotting people who dont belong as soon as i saw you i knew you wereagainst themthem it appeared meant the party and above all the inner party aboutwhom she talked with an open jeering hatred which made winston feel uneasyalthough he knew that they were safe here if they could be safe anywherea thing that astonished him about her was the coarseness of her languageparty members were supposed not to swear and winston himself very seldomdid swear aloud at any rate julia however seemed unable to mentionthe party and especially the inner party without using the kind of wordsthat you saw chalked up in dripping alleyways he did not dislike it itwas merely one symptom of her revolt against the party and all its waysand somehow it seemed natural and healthy like the sneeze of a horse thatsmells bad hay they had left the clearing and were wandering againthrough the chequered shade with their arms round each others waistswhenever it was wide enough to walk two abreast he noticed how muchsofter her waist seemed to feel now that the sash was gone they did notspeak above a whisper outside the clearing julia said it was better togo quietly presently they had reached the edge of the little wood shestopped himdont go out into the open there might be someone watching were allright if we keep behind the boughsthey were standing in the shade of hazel bushes the sunlight filteringthrough innumerable leaves was still hot on their faces winston lookedout into the field beyond and underwent a curious slow shock ofrecognition he knew it by sight an old closebitten pasture with afootpath wandering across it and a molehill here and there in the raggedhedge on the opposite side the boughs of the elm trees swayed justperceptibly in the breeze and their leaves stirred faintly in densemasses like womens hair surely somewhere nearby but out of sightthere must be a stream with green pools where dace were swimmingisnt there a stream somewhere near here he whisperedthats right there is a stream its at the edge of the next fieldactually there are fish in it great big ones you can watch them lyingin the pools under the willow trees waving their tailsits the golden countryalmost he murmuredthe golden countryits nothing really a landscape ive seen sometimes in a dreamlook whispered juliaa thrush had alighted on a bough not five metres away almost at the levelof their faces perhaps it had not seen them it was in the sun they inthe shade it spread out its wings fitted them carefully into placeagain ducked its head for a moment as though making a sort of obeisanceto the sun and then began to pour forth a torrent of song in theafternoon hush the volume of sound was startling winston and julia clungtogether fascinated the music went on and on minute after minute withastonishing variations never once repeating itself almost as though thebird were deliberately showing off its virtuosity sometimes it stoppedfor a few seconds spread out and resettled its wings then swelled itsspeckled breast and again burst into song winston watched it with a sortof vague reverence for whom for what was that bird singing no mateno rival was watching it what made it sit at the edge of the lonely woodand pour its music into nothingness he wondered whether after all therewas a microphone hidden somewhere near he and julia had spoken only inlow whispers and it would not pick up what they had said but it wouldpick up the thrush perhaps at the other end of the instrument some smallbeetlelike man was listening intentlylistening to that but by degreesthe flood of music drove all speculations out of his mind it was asthough it were a kind of liquid stuff that poured all over him and gotmixed up with the sunlight that filtered through the leaves he stoppedthinking and merely felt the girls waist in the bend of his arm was softand warm he pulled her round so that they were breast to breast her bodyseemed to melt into his wherever his hands moved it was all as yielding aswater their mouths clung together it was quite different from the hardkisses they had exchanged earlier when they moved their faces apart againboth of them sighed deeply the bird took fright and fled with a clatterof wingswinston put his lips against her ear now he whisperednot here she whispered back come back to the hideout its saferquickly with an occasional crackle of twigs they threaded their way backto the clearing when they were once inside the ring of saplings she turnedand faced him they were both breathing fast but the smile had reappearedround the corners of her mouth she stood looking at him for an instantthen felt at the zipper of her overalls and yes it was almost as in hisdream almost as swiftly as he had imagined it she had torn her clothesoff and when she flung them aside it was with that same magnificentgesture by which a whole civilization seemed to be annihilated her bodygleamed white in the sun but for a moment he did not look at her bodyhis eyes were anchored by the freckled face with its faint bold smilehe knelt down before her and took her hands in hishave you done this beforeof course hundreds of timeswell scores of times anywaywith party membersyes always with party memberswith members of the inner partynot with those swine no but theres plenty that would if they got halfa chance theyre not so holy as they make outhis heart leapt scores of times she had done it he wished it had beenhundredsthousands anything that hinted at corruption always filled himwith a wild hope who knew perhaps the party was rotten under the surfaceits cult of strenuousness and selfdenial simply a sham concealinginiquity if he could have infected the whole lot of them with leprosy orsyphilis how gladly he would have done so anything to rot to weaken toundermine he pulled her down so that they were kneeling face to facelisten the more men youve had the more i love you do you understandthatyes perfectlyi hate purity i hate goodness i dont want any virtue to exist anywherei want everyone to be corrupt to the boneswell then i ought to suit you dear im corrupt to the bonesyou like doing this i dont mean simply me i mean the thing in itselfi adore itthat was above all what he wanted to hear not merely the love of oneperson but the animal instinct the simple undifferentiated desire thatwas the force that would tear the party to pieces he pressed her downupon the grass among the fallen bluebells this time there was nodifficulty presently the rising and falling of their breasts slowed tonormal speed and in a sort of pleasant helplessness they fell apart thesun seemed to have grown hotter they were both sleepy he reached out forthe discarded overalls and pulled them partly over her almost immediatelythey fell asleep and slept for about half an hourwinston woke first he sat up and watched the freckled face stillpeacefully asleep pillowed on the palm of her hand except for her mouthyou could not call her beautiful there was a line or two round the eyesif you looked closely the short dark hair was extraordinarily thick andsoft it occurred to him that he still did not know her surname or whereshe livedthe young strong body now helpless in sleep awoke in him a pityingprotecting feeling but the mindless tenderness that he had felt underthe hazel tree while the thrush was singing had not quite come backhe pulled the overalls aside and studied her smooth white flank in theold days he thought a man looked at a girls body and saw that it wasdesirable and that was the end of the story but you could not have purelove or pure lust nowadays no emotion was pure because everything wasmixed up with fear and hatred their embrace had been a battle the climaxa victory it was a blow struck against the party it was a political actchapter we can come here once again said julia its generally safe to use anyhideout twice but not for another month or two of courseas soon as she woke up her demeanour had changed she became alert andbusinesslike put her clothes on knotted the scarlet sash about herwaist and began arranging the details of the journey home it seemednatural to leave this to her she obviously had a practical cunning whichwinston lacked and she seemed also to have an exhaustive knowledge of thecountryside round london stored away from innumerable community hikesthe route she gave him was quite different from the one by which he hadcome and brought him out at a different railway station never go homethe same way as you went out she said as though enunciating an importantgeneral principle she would leave first and winston was to wait half anhour before following hershe had named a place where they could meet after work four eveningshence it was a street in one of the poorer quarters where there was anopen market which was generally crowded and noisy she would be hangingabout among the stalls pretending to be in search of shoelaces orsewingthread if she judged that the coast was clear she would blowher nose when he approached otherwise he was to walk past her withoutrecognition but with luck in the middle of the crowd it would besafe to talk for a quarter of an hour and arrange another meetingand now i must go she said as soon as he had mastered his instructionsim due back at nineteenthirty ive got to put in two hours for thejunior antisex league handing out leaflets or something isnt itbloody give me a brushdown would you have i got any twigs in my hairare you sure then goodbye my love goodbyeshe flung herself into his arms kissed him almost violently and a momentlater pushed her way through the saplings and disappeared into the woodwith very little noise even now he had not found out her surname or heraddress however it made no difference for it was inconceivable thatthey could ever meet indoors or exchange any kind of written communicationas it happened they never went back to the clearing in the wood duringthe month of may there was only one further occasion on which they actuallysucceeded in making love that was in another hidingplace known to juliathe belfry of a ruinous church in an almostdeserted stretch of countrywhere an atomic bomb had fallen thirty years earlier it was a goodhidingplace when once you got there but the getting there was verydangerous for the rest they could meet only in the streets in a differentplace every evening and never for more than half an hour at a time in thestreet it was usually possible to talk after a fashion as they drifteddown the crowded pavements not quite abreast and never looking at oneanother they carried on a curious intermittent conversation which flickedon and off like the beams of a lighthouse suddenly nipped into silenceby the approach of a party uniform or the proximity of a telescreen thentaken up again minutes later in the middle of a sentence then abruptlycut short as they parted at the agreed spot then continued almost withoutintroduction on the following day julia appeared to be quite used to thiskind of conversation which she called talking by instalments she wasalso surprisingly adept at speaking without moving her lips just once inalmost a month of nightly meetings they managed to exchange a kiss theywere passing in silence down a sidestreet julia would never speak whenthey were away from the main streets when there was a deafening roar theearth heaved and the air darkened and winston found himself lying on hisside bruised and terrified a rocket bomb must have dropped quite near athand suddenly he became aware of julias face a few centimetres from hisown deathly white as white as chalk even her lips were white she wasdead he clasped her against him and found that he was kissing a livewarm face but there was some powdery stuff that got in the way of hislips both of their faces were thickly coated with plasterthere were evenings when they reached their rendezvous and then had towalk past one another without a sign because a patrol had just come roundthe corner or a helicopter was hovering overhead even if it had beenless dangerous it would still have been difficult to find time to meetwinstons working week was sixty hours julias was even longer andtheir free days varied according to the pressure of work and did notoften coincide julia in any case seldom had an evening completely freeshe spent an astonishing amount of time in attending lectures anddemonstrations distributing literature for the junior antisex leaguepreparing banners for hate week making collections for the savingscampaign and suchlike activities it paid she said it was camouflageif you kept the small rules you could break the big ones she even inducedwinston to mortgage yet another of his evenings by enrolling himself forthe parttime munition work which was done voluntarily by zealous partymembers so one evening every week winston spent four hours of paralysingboredom screwing together small bits of metal which were probably partsof bomb fuses in a draughty illlit workshop where the knocking ofhammers mingled drearily with the music of the telescreenswhen they met in the church tower the gaps in their fragmentaryconversation were filled up it was a blazing afternoon the air in thelittle square chamber above the bells was hot and stagnant and smeltoverpoweringly of pigeon dung they sat talking for hours on the dustytwiglittered floor one or other of them getting up from time to time tocast a glance through the arrowslits and make sure that no one was comingjulia was twentysix years old she lived in a hostel with thirty othergirls always in the stink of women how i hate women she saidparenthetically and she worked as he had guessed on the novelwritingmachines in the fiction department she enjoyed her work which consistedchiefly in running and servicing a powerful but tricky electric motorshe was not clever but was fond of using her hands and felt at homewith machinery she could describe the whole process of composing a novelfrom the general directive issued by the planning committee down to thefinal touchingup by the rewrite squad but she was not interested in thefinished product she didnt much care for reading she said books werejust a commodity that had to be produced like jam or bootlacesshe had no memories of anything before the early sixties and the onlyperson she had ever known who talked frequently of the days before therevolution was a grandfather who had disappeared when she was eight atschool she had been captain of the hockey team and had won the gymnasticstrophy two years running she had been a troopleader in the spies and abranch secretary in the youth league before joining the junior antisexleague she had always borne an excellent character she had even aninfallible mark of good reputation been picked out to work in pornosecthe subsection of the fiction department which turned out cheappornography for distribution among the proles it was nicknamed muck houseby the people who worked in it she remarked there she had remained fora year helping to produce booklets in sealed packets with titles likespanking stories or one night in a girls school to be boughtfurtively by proletarian youths who were under the impression that theywere buying something illegalwhat are these books like said winston curiouslyoh ghastly rubbish theyre boring really they only have six plotsbut they swap them round a bit of course i was only on the kaleidoscopesi was never in the rewrite squad im not literary dearnot even enoughfor thathe learned with astonishment that all the workers in pornosec except theheads of the departments were girls the theory was that men whose sexinstincts were less controllable than those of women were in greaterdanger of being corrupted by the filth they handledthey dont even like having married women there she added girls arealways supposed to be so pure heres one who isnt anywayshe had had her first loveaffair when she was sixteen with a party memberof sixty who later committed suicide to avoid arrest and a good job toosaid julia otherwise theyd have had my name out of him when heconfessed since then there had been various others life as she saw itwas quite simple you wanted a good time they meaning the partywanted to stop you having it you broke the rules as best you could sheseemed to think it just as natural that they should want to rob you ofyour pleasures as that you should want to avoid being caught she hatedthe party and said so in the crudest words but she made no generalcriticism of it except where it touched upon her own life she had nointerest in party doctrine he noticed that she never used newspeak wordsexcept the ones that had passed into everyday use she had never heard ofthe brotherhood and refused to believe in its existence any kind oforganized revolt against the party which was bound to be a failurestruck her as stupid the clever thing was to break the rules and stayalive all the same he wondered vaguely how many others like her theremight be in the younger generation people who had grown up in the world ofthe revolution knowing nothing else accepting the party as somethingunalterable like the sky not rebelling against its authority but simplyevading it as a rabbit dodges a dogthey did not discuss the possibility of getting married it was too remoteto be worth thinking about no imaginable committee would ever sanctionsuch a marriage even if katharine winstons wife could somehow have beengot rid of it was hopeless even as a daydreamwhat was she like your wife said juliashe wasdo you know the newspeak word goodthinkful meaning naturallyorthodox incapable of thinking a bad thoughtno i didnt know the word but i know the kind of person right enoughhe began telling her the story of his married life but curiously enoughshe appeared to know the essential parts of it already she describedto him almost as though she had seen or felt it the stiffening ofkatharines body as soon as he touched her the way in which she stillseemed to be pushing him from her with all her strength even when herarms were clasped tightly round him with julia he felt no difficulty intalking about such things katharine in any case had long ceased to bea painful memory and became merely a distasteful onei could have stood it if it hadnt been for one thing he said he toldher about the frigid little ceremony that katharine had forced him to gothrough on the same night every week she hated it but nothing wouldmake her stop doing it she used to call itbut youll never guessour duty to the party said julia promptlyhow did you know thative been at school too dear sex talks once a month for theoversixteens and in the youth movement they rub it into you for yearsi dare say it works in a lot of cases but of course you can never tellpeople are such hypocritesshe began to enlarge upon the subject with julia everything came backto her own sexuality as soon as this was touched upon in any way she wascapable of great acuteness unlike winston she had grasped the innermeaning of the partys sexual puritanism it was not merely that the sexinstinct created a world of its own which was outside the partys controland which therefore had to be destroyed if possible what was moreimportant was that sexual privation induced hysteria which was desirablebecause it could be transformed into warfever and leaderworship the wayshe put it waswhen you make love youre using up energy and afterwards you feel happyand dont give a damn for anything they cant bear you to feel like thatthey want you to be bursting with energy all the time all this marchingup and down and cheering and waving flags is simply sex gone sour ifyoure happy inside yourself why should you get excited about big brotherand the threeyear plans and the two minutes hate and all the rest oftheir bloody rotthat was very true he thought there was a direct intimate connexionbetween chastity and political orthodoxy for how could the fear thehatred and the lunatic credulity which the party needed in its members bekept at the right pitch except by bottling down some powerful instinctand using it as a driving force the sex impulse was dangerous to theparty and the party had turned it to account they had played a similartrick with the instinct of parenthood the family could not actually beabolished and indeed people were encouraged to be fond of theirchildren in almost the oldfashioned way the children on the other handwere systematically turned against their parents and taught to spy on themand report their deviations the family had become in effect an extensionof the thought police it was a device by means of which everyone could besurrounded night and day by informers who knew him intimatelyabruptly his mind went back to katharine katharine would unquestionablyhave denounced him to the thought police if she had not happened to be toostupid to detect the unorthodoxy of his opinions but what really recalledher to him at this moment was the stifling heat of the afternoon whichhad brought the sweat out on his forehead he began telling julia ofsomething that had happened or rather had failed to happen on anothersweltering summer afternoon eleven years agoit was three or four months after they were married they had lost theirway on a community hike somewhere in kent they had only lagged behindthe others for a couple of minutes but they took a wrong turning andpresently found themselves pulled up short by the edge of an old chalkquarry it was a sheer drop of ten or twenty metres with boulders at thebottom there was nobody of whom they could ask the way as soon as sherealized that they were lost katharine became very uneasy to be awayfrom the noisy mob of hikers even for a moment gave her a feeling ofwrongdoing she wanted to hurry back by the way they had come and startsearching in the other direction but at this moment winston noticed sometufts of loosestrife growing in the cracks of the cliff beneath themone tuft was of two colours magenta and brickred apparently growing onthe same root he had never seen anything of the kind before and he calledto katharine to come and look at itlook katharine look at those flowers that clump down near the bottomdo you see theyre two different coloursshe had already turned to go but she did rather fretfully come back fora moment she even leaned out over the cliff face to see where he waspointing he was standing a little behind her and he put his hand onher waist to steady her at this moment it suddenly occurred to him howcompletely alone they were there was not a human creature anywhere not aleaf stirring not even a bird awake in a place like this the danger thatthere would be a hidden microphone was very small and even if there was amicrophone it would only pick up sounds it was the hottest sleepiest hourof the afternoon the sun blazed down upon them the sweat tickled hisface and the thought struck himwhy didnt you give her a good shove said julia i would haveyes dear you would have i would if id been the same person then asi am now or perhaps i wouldim not certainare you sorry you didntyes on the whole im sorry i didntthey were sitting side by side on the dusty floor he pulled her closeragainst him her head rested on his shoulder the pleasant smell of herhair conquering the pigeon dung she was very young he thought shestill expected something from life she did not understand that to pushan inconvenient person over a cliff solves nothingactually it would have made no difference he saidthen why are you sorry you didnt do itonly because i prefer a positive to a negative in this game that wereplaying we cant win some kinds of failure are better than other kindsthats allhe felt her shoulders give a wriggle of dissent she always contradictedhim when he said anything of this kind she would not accept it as a lawof nature that the individual is always defeated in a way she realizedthat she herself was doomed that sooner or later the thought police wouldcatch her and kill her but with another part of her mind she believedthat it was somehow possible to construct a secret world in which you couldlive as you chose all you needed was luck and cunning and boldness shedid not understand that there was no such thing as happiness that theonly victory lay in the far future long after you were dead that fromthe moment of declaring war on the party it was better to think of yourselfas a corpsewe are the dead he saidwere not dead yet said julia prosaicallynot physically six months a yearfive years conceivably i am afraidof death you are young so presumably youre more afraid of it than i amobviously we shall put it off as long as we can but it makes very littledifference so long as human beings stay human death and life are thesame thingoh rubbish which would you sooner sleep with me or a skeleton dontyou enjoy being alive dont you like feeling this is me this is my handthis is my leg im real im solid im alive dont you like thisshe twisted herself round and pressed her bosom against him he could feelher breasts ripe yet firm through her overalls her body seemed to bepouring some of its youth and vigour into hisyes i like that he saidthen stop talking about dying and now listen dear weve got to fixup about the next time we meet we may as well go back to the place inthe wood weve given it a good long rest but you must get there by adifferent way this time ive got it all planned out you take thetrainbut look ill draw it out for youand in her practical way she scraped together a small square of dustand with a twig from a pigeons nest began drawing a map on the floorchapter winston looked round the shabby little room above mr charringtons shopbeside the window the enormous bed was made up with ragged blankets anda coverless bolster the oldfashioned clock with the twelvehour face wasticking away on the mantelpiece in the corner on the gateleg table theglass paperweight which he had bought on his last visit gleamed softly outof the halfdarknessin the fender was a battered tin oilstove a saucepan and two cupsprovided by mr charrington winston lit the burner and set a pan of waterto boil he had brought an envelope full of victory coffee and somesaccharine tablets the clocks hands said seventeentwenty it wasnineteentwenty really she was coming at nineteenthirtyfolly folly his heart kept saying conscious gratuitous suicidal follyof all the crimes that a party member could commit this one was the leastpossible to conceal actually the idea had first floated into his head inthe form of a vision of the glass paperweight mirrored by the surfaceof the gateleg table as he had foreseen mr charrington had made nodifficulty about letting the room he was obviously glad of the few dollarsthat it would bring him nor did he seem shocked or become offensivelyknowing when it was made clear that winston wanted the room for the purposeof a loveaffair instead he looked into the middle distance and spoke ingeneralities with so delicate an air as to give the impression that hehad become partly invisible privacy he said was a very valuable thingeveryone wanted a place where they could be alone occasionally and whenthey had such a place it was only common courtesy in anyone else who knewof it to keep his knowledge to himself he even seeming almost to fadeout of existence as he did so added that there were two entries to thehouse one of them through the back yard which gave on an alleyunder the window somebody was singing winston peeped out secure in theprotection of the muslin curtain the june sun was still high in the skyand in the sunfilled court below a monstrous woman solid as a normanpillar with brawny red forearms and a sacking apron strapped about hermiddle was stumping to and fro between a washtub and a clothes linepegging out a series of square white things which winston recognized asbabies diapers whenever her mouth was not corked with clothes pegs shewas singing in a powerful contralto  it was only an opeless fancy  it passed like an ipril dye  but a look an a word an the dreams they stirred  they ave stolen my eart awyethe tune had been haunting london for weeks past it was one of countlesssimilar songs published for the benefit of the proles by a subsection ofthe music department the words of these songs were composed without anyhuman intervention whatever on an instrument known as a versificatorbut the woman sang so tunefully as to turn the dreadful rubbish into analmost pleasant sound he could hear the woman singing and the scrape ofher shoes on the flagstones and the cries of the children in the streetand somewhere in the far distance a faint roar of traffic and yet theroom seemed curiously silent thanks to the absence of a telescreenfolly folly folly he thought again it was inconceivable that they couldfrequent this place for more than a few weeks without being caught butthe temptation of having a hidingplace that was truly their own indoorsand near at hand had been too much for both of them for some timeafter their visit to the church belfry it had been impossible to arrangemeetings working hours had been drastically increased in anticipation ofhate week it was more than a month distant but the enormous complexpreparations that it entailed were throwing extra work on to everybodyfinally both of them managed to secure a free afternoon on the same daythey had agreed to go back to the clearing in the wood on the eveningbeforehand they met briefly in the street as usual winston hardly lookedat julia as they drifted towards one another in the crowd but from theshort glance he gave her it seemed to him that she was paler than usualits all off she murmured as soon as she judged it safe to speaktomorrow i meanwhattomorrow afternoon i cant comewhy notoh the usual reason its started early this timefor a moment he was violently angry during the month that he had knownher the nature of his desire for her had changed at the beginning therehad been little true sensuality in it their first lovemaking had beensimply an act of the will but after the second time it was different thesmell of her hair the taste of her mouth the feeling of her skin seemedto have got inside him or into the air all round him she had become aphysical necessity something that he not only wanted but felt that hehad a right to when she said that she could not come he had the feelingthat she was cheating him but just at this moment the crowd pressedthem together and their hands accidentally met she gave the tips of hisfingers a quick squeeze that seemed to invite not desire but affection itstruck him that when one lived with a woman this particular disappointmentmust be a normal recurring event and a deep tenderness such as he hadnot felt for her before suddenly took hold of him he wished that theywere a married couple of ten years standing he wished that he werewalking through the streets with her just as they were doing now but openlyand without fear talking of trivialities and buying odds and ends for thehousehold he wished above all that they had some place where they couldbe alone together without feeling the obligation to make love every timethey met it was not actually at that moment but at some time on thefollowing day that the idea of renting mr charringtons room had occurredto him when he suggested it to julia she had agreed with unexpectedreadiness both of them knew that it was lunacy it was as though they wereintentionally stepping nearer to their graves as he sat waiting on theedge of the bed he thought again of the cellars of the ministry of loveit was curious how that predestined horror moved in and out of onesconsciousness there it lay fixed in future times preceding death assurely as  precedes  one could not avoid it but one could perhapspostpone it and yet instead every now and again by a conscious wilfulact one chose to shorten the interval before it happenedat this moment there was a quick step on the stairs julia burst into theroom she was carrying a toolbag of coarse brown canvas such as he hadsometimes seen her carrying to and fro at the ministry he started forwardto take her in his arms but she disengaged herself rather hurriedlypartly because she was still holding the toolbaghalf a second she said just let me show you what ive brought didyou bring some of that filthy victory coffee i thought you would youcan chuck it away again because we shant be needing it look hereshe fell on her knees threw open the bag and tumbled out some spannersand a screwdriver that filled the top part of it underneath were a numberof neat paper packets the first packet that she passed to winston had astrange and yet vaguely familiar feeling it was filled with some kind ofheavy sandlike stuff which yielded wherever you touched itit isnt sugar he saidreal sugar not saccharine sugar and heres a loaf of breadproperwhite bread not our bloody stuffand a little pot of jam and heres atin of milkbut look this is the one im really proud of i had to wrapa bit of sacking round it becausebut she did not need to tell him why she had wrapped it up the smell wasalready filling the room a rich hot smell which seemed like an emanationfrom his early childhood but which one did occasionally meet with evennow blowing down a passageway before a door slammed or diffusing itselfmysteriously in a crowded street sniffed for an instant and then lostagainits coffee he murmured real coffeeits inner party coffee theres a whole kilo here she saidhow did you manage to get hold of all these thingsits all inner party stuff theres nothing those swine dont havenothing but of course waiters and servants and people pinch thingsandlook i got a little packet of tea as wellwinston had squatted down beside her he tore open a corner of the packetits real tea not blackberry leavestheres been a lot of tea about lately theyve captured india orsomething she said vaguely but listen dear i want you to turn yourback on me for three minutes go and sit on the other side of the beddont go too near the window and dont turn round till i tell youwinston gazed abstractedly through the muslin curtain down in the yardthe redarmed woman was still marching to and fro between the washtub andthe line she took two more pegs out of her mouth and sang with deepfeeling  they sye that time eals all things  they sye you can always forget  but the smiles an the tears acrorss the years  they twist my eartstrings yetshe knew the whole drivelling song by heart it seemed her voice floatedupward with the sweet summer air very tuneful charged with a sort ofhappy melancholy one had the feeling that she would have been perfectlycontent if the june evening had been endless and the supply of clothesinexhaustible to remain there for a thousand years pegging out diapersand singing rubbish it struck him as a curious fact that he had neverheard a member of the party singing alone and spontaneously it would evenhave seemed slightly unorthodox a dangerous eccentricity like talking tooneself perhaps it was only when people were somewhere near the starvationlevel that they had anything to sing aboutyou can turn round now said juliahe turned round and for a second almost failed to recognize her what hehad actually expected was to see her naked but she was not naked thetransformation that had happened was much more surprising than that shehad painted her faceshe must have slipped into some shop in the proletarian quarters and boughtherself a complete set of makeup materials her lips were deeply reddenedher cheeks rouged her nose powdered there was even a touch of somethingunder the eyes to make them brighter it was not very skilfully done butwinstons standards in such matters were not high he had never beforeseen or imagined a woman of the party with cosmetics on her face theimprovement in her appearance was startling with just a few dabs of colourin the right places she had become not only very much prettier but aboveall far more feminine her short hair and boyish overalls merely addedto the effect as he took her in his arms a wave of synthetic violetsflooded his nostrils he remembered the halfdarkness of a basementkitchen and a womans cavernous mouth it was the very same scent thatshe had used but at the moment it did not seem to matterscent too he saidyes dear scent too and do you know what im going to do next imgoing to get hold of a real womans frock from somewhere and wear itinstead of these bloody trousers ill wear silk stockings and highheeledshoes in this room im going to be a woman not a party comradethey flung their clothes off and climbed into the huge mahogany bed itwas the first time that he had stripped himself naked in her presenceuntil now he had been too much ashamed of his pale and meagre body withthe varicose veins standing out on his calves and the discoloured patchover his ankle there were no sheets but the blanket they lay on wasthreadbare and smooth and the size and springiness of the bed astonishedboth of them its sure to be full of bugs but who cares said juliaone never saw a double bed nowadays except in the homes of the proleswinston had occasionally slept in one in his boyhood julia had never beenin one before so far as she could rememberpresently they fell asleep for a little while when winston woke up thehands of the clock had crept round to nearly nine he did not stir becausejulia was sleeping with her head in the crook of his arm most of hermakeup had transferred itself to his own face or the bolster but a lightstain of rouge still brought out the beauty of her cheekbone a yellow rayfrom the sinking sun fell across the foot of the bed and lighted up thefireplace where the water in the pan was boiling fast down in the yardthe woman had stopped singing but the faint shouts of children floated infrom the street he wondered vaguely whether in the abolished past it hadbeen a normal experience to lie in bed like this in the cool of a summerevening a man and a woman with no clothes on making love when they chosetalking of what they chose not feeling any compulsion to get up simplylying there and listening to peaceful sounds outside surely there couldnever have been a time when that seemed ordinary julia woke up rubbedher eyes and raised herself on her elbow to look at the oilstovehalf that waters boiled away she said ill get up and make somecoffee in another moment weve got an hour what time do they cut thelights off at your flatstwentythree thirtyits twentythree at the hostel but you have to get in earlier than thatbecausehi get out you filthy bruteshe suddenly twisted herself over in the bed seized a shoe from the floorand sent it hurtling into the corner with a boyish jerk of her arm exactlyas he had seen her fling the dictionary at goldstein that morning duringthe two minutes hatewhat was it he said in surprisea rat i saw him stick his beastly nose out of the wainscoting theres ahole down there i gave him a good fright anywayrats murmured winston in this roomtheyre all over the place said julia indifferently as she lay downagain weve even got them in the kitchen at the hostel some parts oflondon are swarming with them did you know they attack children yesthey do in some of these streets a woman darent leave a baby alone fortwo minutes its the great huge brown ones that do it and the nastything is that the brutes alwaysdont go on said winston with his eyes tightly shutdearest youve gone quite pale whats the matter do they make you feelsickof all horrors in the worlda ratshe pressed herself against him and wound her limbs round him as thoughto reassure him with the warmth of her body he did not reopen his eyesimmediately for several moments he had had the feeling of being back in anightmare which had recurred from time to time throughout his life it wasalways very much the same he was standing in front of a wall of darknessand on the other side of it there was something unendurable something toodreadful to be faced in the dream his deepest feeling was always one ofselfdeception because he did in fact know what was behind the wall ofdarkness with a deadly effort like wrenching a piece out of his ownbrain he could even have dragged the thing into the open he always wokeup without discovering what it was but somehow it was connected with whatjulia had been saying when he cut her shortim sorry he said its nothing i dont like rats thats alldont worry dear were not going to have the filthy brutes in hereill stuff the hole with a bit of sacking before we go and next time wecome here ill bring some plaster and bung it up properlyalready the black instant of panic was halfforgotten feeling slightlyashamed of himself he sat up against the bedhead julia got out of bedpulled on her overalls and made the coffee the smell that rose from thesaucepan was so powerful and exciting that they shut the window lestanybody outside should notice it and become inquisitive what was evenbetter than the taste of the coffee was the silky texture given to it bythe sugar a thing winston had almost forgotten after years of saccharinewith one hand in her pocket and a piece of bread and jam in the otherjulia wandered about the room glancing indifferently at the bookcasepointing out the best way of repairing the gateleg table plumping herselfdown in the ragged armchair to see if it was comfortable and examiningthe absurd twelvehour clock with a sort of tolerant amusement she broughtthe glass paperweight over to the bed to have a look at it in a betterlight he took it out of her hand fascinated as always by the softrainwatery appearance of the glasswhat is it do you think said juliai dont think its anythingi mean i dont think it was ever put to anyuse thats what i like about it its a little chunk of history thattheyve forgotten to alter its a message from a hundred years ago ifone knew how to read itand that picture over thereshe nodded at the engraving on the oppositewallwould that be a hundred years oldmore two hundred i dare say one cant tell its impossible to discoverthe age of anything nowadaysshe went over to look at it heres where that brute stuck his nose outshe said kicking the wainscoting immediately below the picture what isthis place ive seen it before somewhereits a church or at least it used to be st clement danes its name wasthe fragment of rhyme that mr charrington had taught him came back intohis head and he added halfnostalgically oranges and lemons say thebells of st clementsto his astonishment she capped the line  you owe me three farthings say the bells of st martins  when will you pay me say the bells of old baileyi cant remember how it goes on after that but anyway i remember it endsup here comes a candle to light you to bed here comes a chopper to chopoff your headit was like the two halves of a countersign but there must be anotherline after the bells of old bailey perhaps it could be dug out ofmr charringtons memory if he were suitably promptedwho taught you that he saidmy grandfather he used to say it to me when i was a little girl he wasvaporized when i was eightat any rate he disappeared i wonder what alemon was she added inconsequently ive seen oranges theyre a kindof round yellow fruit with a thick skini can remember lemons said winston they were quite common in thefifties they were so sour that it set your teeth on edge even to smellthemi bet that pictures got bugs behind it said julia ill take it downand give it a good clean some day i suppose its almost time we wereleaving i must start washing this paint off what a bore ill get thelipstick off your face afterwardswinston did not get up for a few minutes more the room was darkening heturned over towards the light and lay gazing into the glass paperweightthe inexhaustibly interesting thing was not the fragment of coral but theinterior of the glass itself there was such a depth of it and yet it wasalmost as transparent as air it was as though the surface of the glasshad been the arch of the sky enclosing a tiny world with its atmospherecomplete he had the feeling that he could get inside it and that infact he was inside it along with the mahogany bed and the gateleg tableand the clock and the steel engraving and the paperweight itself thepaperweight was the room he was in and the coral was julias life and hisown fixed in a sort of eternity at the heart of the crystalchapter syme had vanished a morning came and he was missing from work a fewthoughtless people commented on his absence on the next day nobodymentioned him on the third day winston went into the vestibule of therecords department to look at the noticeboard one of the notices carrieda printed list of the members of the chess committee of whom syme hadbeen one it looked almost exactly as it had looked beforenothing hadbeen crossed outbut it was one name shorter it was enough syme hadceased to exist he had never existedthe weather was baking hot in the labyrinthine ministry the windowlessairconditioned rooms kept their normal temperature but outside thepavements scorched ones feet and the stench of the tubes at the rush hourswas a horror the preparations for hate week were in full swing and thestaffs of all the ministries were working overtime processions meetingsmilitary parades lectures waxworks displays film shows telescreenprogrammes all had to be organized stands had to be erected effigiesbuilt slogans coined songs written rumours circulated photographsfaked julias unit in the fiction department had been taken off theproduction of novels and was rushing out a series of atrocity pamphletswinston in addition to his regular work spent long periods every day ingoing through back files of the times and altering and embellishing newsitems which were to be quoted in speeches late at night when crowds ofrowdy proles roamed the streets the town had a curiously febrile air therocket bombs crashed oftener than ever and sometimes in the far distancethere were enormous explosions which no one could explain and about whichthere were wild rumoursthe new tune which was to be the themesong of hate week the hate songit was called had already been composed and was being endlessly pluggedon the telescreens it had a savage barking rhythm which could not exactlybe called music but resembled the beating of a drum roared out byhundreds of voices to the tramp of marching feet it was terrifying theproles had taken a fancy to it and in the midnight streets it competedwith the stillpopular it was only a hopeless fancy the parsons childrenplayed it at all hours of the night and day unbearably on a comb and apiece of toilet paper winstons evenings were fuller than ever squads ofvolunteers organized by parsons were preparing the street for hate weekstitching banners painting posters erecting flagstaffs on the roofs andperilously slinging wires across the street for the reception of streamersparsons boasted that victory mansions alone would display four hundredmetres of bunting he was in his native element and as happy as a larkthe heat and the manual work had even given him a pretext for revertingto shorts and an open shirt in the evenings he was everywhere at oncepushing pulling sawing hammering improvising jollying everyone alongwith comradely exhortations and giving out from every fold of his body whatseemed an inexhaustible supply of acridsmelling sweata new poster had suddenly appeared all over london it had no captionand represented simply the monstrous figure of a eurasian soldier threeor four metres high striding forward with expressionless mongolian faceand enormous boots a submachine gun pointed from his hip from whateverangle you looked at the poster the muzzle of the gun magnified by theforeshortening seemed to be pointed straight at you the thing had beenplastered on every blank space on every wall even outnumbering theportraits of big brother the proles normally apathetic about the warwere being lashed into one of their periodical frenzies of patriotismas though to harmonize with the general mood the rocket bombs had beenkilling larger numbers of people than usual one fell on a crowded filmtheatre in stepney burying several hundred victims among the ruins thewhole population of the neighbourhood turned out for a long trailingfuneral which went on for hours and was in effect an indignation meetinganother bomb fell on a piece of waste ground which was used as a playgroundand several dozen children were blown to pieces there were further angrydemonstrations goldstein was burned in effigy hundreds of copies of theposter of the eurasian soldier were torn down and added to the flames anda number of shops were looted in the turmoil then a rumour flew roundthat spies were directing the rocket bombs by means of wireless waves andan old couple who were suspected of being of foreign extraction had theirhouse set on fire and perished of suffocationin the room over mr charringtons shop when they could get there juliaand winston lay side by side on a stripped bed under the open windownaked for the sake of coolness the rat had never come back but the bugshad multiplied hideously in the heat it did not seem to matter dirty orclean the room was paradise as soon as they arrived they would sprinkleeverything with pepper bought on the black market tear off their clothesand make love with sweating bodies then fall asleep and wake to find thatthe bugs had rallied and were massing for the counterattackfour five sixseven times they met during the month of june winstonhad dropped his habit of drinking gin at all hours he seemed to have lostthe need for it he had grown fatter his varicose ulcer had subsidedleaving only a brown stain on the skin above his ankle his fits ofcoughing in the early morning had stopped the process of life had ceasedto be intolerable he had no longer any impulse to make faces at thetelescreen or shout curses at the top of his voice now that they had asecure hidingplace almost a home it did not even seem a hardship thatthey could only meet infrequently and for a couple of hours at a timewhat mattered was that the room over the junkshop should exist to knowthat it was there inviolate was almost the same as being in it the roomwas a world a pocket of the past where extinct animals could walkmr charrington thought winston was another extinct animal he usuallystopped to talk with mr charrington for a few minutes on his way upstairsthe old man seemed seldom or never to go out of doors and on the otherhand to have almost no customers he led a ghostlike existence between thetiny dark shop and an even tinier back kitchen where he prepared hismeals and which contained among other things an unbelievably ancientgramophone with an enormous horn he seemed glad of the opportunity totalk wandering about among his worthless stock with his long nose andthick spectacles and his bowed shoulders in the velvet jacket he hadalways vaguely the air of being a collector rather than a tradesmanwith a sort of faded enthusiasm he would finger this scrap of rubbish orthata china bottlestopper the painted lid of a broken snuffbox apinchbeck locket containing a strand of some longdead babys hairneverasking that winston should buy it merely that he should admire it totalk to him was like listening to the tinkling of a wornout musicalboxhe had dragged out from the corners of his memory some more fragments offorgotten rhymes there was one about four and twenty blackbirds andanother about a cow with a crumpled horn and another about the deathof poor cock robin it just occurred to me you might be interested hewould say with a deprecating little laugh whenever he produced a newfragment but he could never recall more than a few lines of any onerhymeboth of them knewin a way it was never out of their minds that whatwas now happening could not last long there were times when the fact ofimpending death seemed as palpable as the bed they lay on and they wouldcling together with a sort of despairing sensuality like a damned soulgrasping at his last morsel of pleasure when the clock is within fiveminutes of striking but there were also times when they had the illusionnot only of safety but of permanence so long as they were actually inthis room they both felt no harm could come to them getting there wasdifficult and dangerous but the room itself was sanctuary it was as whenwinston had gazed into the heart of the paperweight with the feeling thatit would be possible to get inside that glassy world and that once insideit time could be arrested often they gave themselves up to daydreams ofescape their luck would hold indefinitely and they would carry on theirintrigue just like this for the remainder of their natural lives orkatharine would die and by subtle manoeuvrings winston and julia wouldsucceed in getting married or they would commit suicide together orthey would disappear alter themselves out of recognition learn to speakwith proletarian accents get jobs in a factory and live out their livesundetected in a backstreet it was all nonsense as they both knew inreality there was no escape even the one plan that was practicablesuicide they had no intention of carrying out to hang on from day to dayand from week to week spinning out a present that had no future seemedan unconquerable instinct just as ones lungs will always draw the nextbreath so long as there is air availablesometimes too they talked of engaging in active rebellion against theparty but with no notion of how to take the first step even if thefabulous brotherhood was a reality there still remained the difficultyof finding ones way into it he told her of the strange intimacy thatexisted or seemed to exist between himself and obrien and of theimpulse he sometimes felt simply to walk into obriens presence announcethat he was the enemy of the party and demand his help curiously enoughthis did not strike her as an impossibly rash thing to do she was used tojudging people by their faces and it seemed natural to her that winstonshould believe obrien to be trustworthy on the strength of a single flashof the eyes moreover she took it for granted that everyone or nearlyeveryone secretly hated the party and would break the rules if he thoughtit safe to do so but she refused to believe that widespread organizedopposition existed or could exist the tales about goldstein and hisunderground army she said were simply a lot of rubbish which the partyhad invented for its own purposes and which you had to pretend to believein times beyond number at party rallies and spontaneous demonstrationsshe had shouted at the top of her voice for the execution of people whosenames she had never heard and in whose supposed crimes she had not thefaintest belief when public trials were happening she had taken her placein the detachments from the youth league who surrounded the courts frommorning to night chanting at intervals death to the traitors duringthe two minutes hate she always excelled all others in shouting insultsat goldstein yet she had only the dimmest idea of who goldstein was andwhat doctrines he was supposed to represent she had grown up since therevolution and was too young to remember the ideological battles of thefifties and sixties such a thing as an independent political movement wasoutside her imagination and in any case the party was invincible itwould always exist and it would always be the same you could only rebelagainst it by secret disobedience or at most by isolated acts ofviolence such as killing somebody or blowing something upin some ways she was far more acute than winston and far less susceptibleto party propaganda once when he happened in some connexion to mentionthe war against eurasia she startled him by saying casually that in heropinion the war was not happening the rocket bombs which fell daily onlondon were probably fired by the government of oceania itself just tokeep people frightened this was an idea that had literally never occurredto him she also stirred a sort of envy in him by telling him that duringthe two minutes hate her great difficulty was to avoid bursting outlaughing but she only questioned the teachings of the party when theyin some way touched upon her own life often she was ready to acceptthe official mythology simply because the difference between truth andfalsehood did not seem important to her she believed for instance havinglearnt it at school that the party had invented aeroplanes in his ownschooldays winston remembered in the late fifties it was only thehelicopter that the party claimed to have invented a dozen years laterwhen julia was at school it was already claiming the aeroplane onegeneration more and it would be claiming the steam engine and when hetold her that aeroplanes had been in existence before he was born and longbefore the revolution the fact struck her as totally uninteresting afterall what did it matter who had invented aeroplanes it was rather moreof a shock to him when he discovered from some chance remark that she didnot remember that oceania four years ago had been at war with eastasiaand at peace with eurasia it was true that she regarded the whole war asa sham but apparently she had not even noticed that the name of the enemyhad changed i thought wed always been at war with eurasia she saidvaguely it frightened him a little the invention of aeroplanes datedfrom long before her birth but the switchover in the war had happenedonly four years ago well after she was grown up he argued with her aboutit for perhaps a quarter of an hour in the end he succeeded in forcingher memory back until she did dimly recall that at one time eastasia andnot eurasia had been the enemy but the issue still struck her asunimportant who cares she said impatiently its always one bloodywar after another and one knows the news is all lies anywaysometimes he talked to her of the records department and the impudentforgeries that he committed there such things did not appear to horrifyher she did not feel the abyss opening beneath her feet at the thoughtof lies becoming truths he told her the story of jones aaronson andrutherford and the momentous slip of paper which he had once held betweenhis fingers it did not make much impression on her at first indeed shefailed to grasp the point of the storywere they friends of yours she saidno i never knew them they were inner party members besides they werefar older men than i was they belonged to the old days before therevolution i barely knew them by sightthen what was there to worry about people are being killed off all thetime arent theyhe tried to make her understand this was an exceptional case it wasntjust a question of somebody being killed do you realize that the paststarting from yesterday has been actually abolished if it survivesanywhere its in a few solid objects with no words attached to them likethat lump of glass there already we know almost literally nothing aboutthe revolution and the years before the revolution every record has beendestroyed or falsified every book has been rewritten every picture hasbeen repainted every statue and street and building has been renamedevery date has been altered and that process is continuing day by day andminute by minute history has stopped nothing exists except an endlesspresent in which the party is always right i know of course that thepast is falsified but it would never be possible for me to prove it evenwhen i did the falsification myself after the thing is done no evidenceever remains the only evidence is inside my own mind and i dont knowwith any certainty that any other human being shares my memories just inthat one instance in my whole life i did possess actual concrete evidenceafter the eventyears after itand what good was thatit was no good because i threw it away a few minutes later but if thesame thing happened today i should keep itwell i wouldnt said julia im quite ready to take risks but onlyfor something worth while not for bits of old newspaper what could youhave done with it even if you had kept itnot much perhaps but it was evidence it might have planted a few doubtshere and there supposing that id dared to show it to anybody i dontimagine that we can alter anything in our own lifetime but one can imaginelittle knots of resistance springing up here and theresmall groups ofpeople banding themselves together and gradually growing and even leavinga few records behind so that the next generations can carry on where weleave offim not interested in the next generation dear im interested in usyoure only a rebel from the waist downwards he told hershe thought this brilliantly witty and flung her arms round him in delightin the ramifications of party doctrine she had not the faintest interestwhenever he began to talk of the principles of ingsoc doublethink themutability of the past and the denial of objective reality and to usenewspeak words she became bored and confused and said that she never paidany attention to that kind of thing one knew that it was all rubbish sowhy let oneself be worried by it she knew when to cheer and when to booand that was all one needed if he persisted in talking of such subjectsshe had a disconcerting habit of falling asleep she was one of thosepeople who can go to sleep at any hour and in any position talking to herhe realized how easy it was to present an appearance of orthodoxy whilehaving no grasp whatever of what orthodoxy meant in a way the worldviewof the party imposed itself most successfully on people incapable ofunderstanding it they could be made to accept the most flagrant violationsof reality because they never fully grasped the enormity of what wasdemanded of them and were not sufficiently interested in public events tonotice what was happening by lack of understanding they remained sanethey simply swallowed everything and what they swallowed did them no harmbecause it left no residue behind just as a grain of corn will passundigested through the body of a birdchapter it had happened at last the expected message had come all his life itseemed to him he had been waiting for this to happenhe was walking down the long corridor at the ministry and he was almostat the spot where julia had slipped the note into his hand when he becameaware that someone larger than himself was walking just behind him theperson whoever it was gave a small cough evidently as a prelude tospeaking winston stopped abruptly and turned it was obrienat last they were face to face and it seemed that his only impulse wasto run away his heart bounded violently he would have been incapable ofspeaking obrien however had continued forward in the same movementlaying a friendly hand for a moment on winstons arm so that the two ofthem were walking side by side he began speaking with the peculiar gravecourtesy that differentiated him from the majority of inner party membersi had been hoping for an opportunity of talking to you he said i wasreading one of your newspeak articles in the times the other day youtake a scholarly interest in newspeak i believewinston had recovered part of his selfpossession hardly scholarly hesaid im only an amateur its not my subject i have never had anythingto do with the actual construction of the languagebut you write it very elegantly said obrien that is not only my ownopinion i was talking recently to a friend of yours who is certainly anexpert his name has slipped my memory for the momentagain winstons heart stirred painfully it was inconceivable that thiswas anything other than a reference to syme but syme was not only deadhe was abolished an unperson any identifiable reference to him would havebeen mortally dangerous obriens remark must obviously have been intendedas a signal a codeword by sharing a small act of thoughtcrime he hadturned the two of them into accomplices they had continued to strollslowly down the corridor but now obrien halted with the curiousdisarming friendliness that he always managed to put in to the gesture heresettled his spectacles on his nose then he went onwhat i had really intended to say was that in your article i noticed youhad used two words which have become obsolete but they have only becomeso very recently have you seen the tenth edition of the newspeakdictionaryno said winston i didnt think it had been issued yet we are stillusing the ninth in the records departmentthe tenth edition is not due to appear for some months i believe but afew advance copies have been circulated i have one myself it mightinterest you to look at it perhapsvery much so said winston immediately seeing where this tendedsome of the new developments are most ingenious the reduction in thenumber of verbsthat is the point that will appeal to you i think letme see shall i send a messenger to you with the dictionary but i amafraid i invariably forget anything of that kind perhaps you could pickit up at my flat at some time that suited you wait let me give you myaddressthey were standing in front of a telescreen somewhat absentmindedlyobrien felt two of his pockets and then produced a small leathercoverednotebook and a gold inkpencil immediately beneath the telescreen insuch a position that anyone who was watching at the other end of theinstrument could read what he was writing he scribbled an address toreout the page and handed it to winstoni am usually at home in the evenings he said if not my servant willgive you the dictionaryhe was gone leaving winston holding the scrap of paper which this timethere was no need to conceal nevertheless he carefully memorized what waswritten on it and some hours later dropped it into the memory hole alongwith a mass of other papersthey had been talking to one another for a couple of minutes at the mostthere was only one meaning that the episode could possibly have it hadbeen contrived as a way of letting winston know obriens address thiswas necessary because except by direct enquiry it was never possible todiscover where anyone lived there were no directories of any kind ifyou ever want to see me this is where i can be found was what obrienhad been saying to him perhaps there would even be a message concealedsomewhere in the dictionary but at any rate one thing was certain theconspiracy that he had dreamed of did exist and he had reached the outeredges of ithe knew that sooner or later he would obey obriens summons perhapstomorrow perhaps after a long delayhe was not certain what washappening was only the workingout of a process that had started yearsago the first step had been a secret involuntary thought the secondhad been the opening of the diary he had moved from thoughts to wordsand now from words to actions the last step was something that wouldhappen in the ministry of love he had accepted it the end was containedin the beginning but it was frightening or more exactly it was likea foretaste of death like being a little less alive even while he wasspeaking to obrien when the meaning of the words had sunk in a chillyshuddering feeling had taken possession of his body he had the sensationof stepping into the dampness of a grave and it was not much betterbecause he had always known that the grave was there and waiting for himchapter winston had woken up with his eyes full of tears julia rolled sleepilyagainst him murmuring something that might have been whats the matteri dreamt he began and stopped short it was too complex to be putinto words there was the dream itself and there was a memory connectedwith it that had swum into his mind in the few seconds after wakinghe lay back with his eyes shut still sodden in the atmosphere of thedream it was a vast luminous dream in which his whole life seemed tostretch out before him like a landscape on a summer evening after rainit had all occurred inside the glass paperweight but the surface of theglass was the dome of the sky and inside the dome everything was floodedwith clear soft light in which one could see into interminable distancesthe dream had also been comprehended byindeed in some sense it hadconsisted ina gesture of the arm made by his mother and made againthirty years later by the jewish woman he had seen on the news filmtrying to shelter the small boy from the bullets before the helicopterblew them both to piecesdo you know he said that until this moment i believed i had murderedmy motherwhy did you murder her said julia almost asleepi didnt murder her not physicallyin the dream he had remembered his last glimpse of his mother and withina few moments of waking the cluster of small events surrounding it had allcome back it was a memory that he must have deliberately pushed out ofhis consciousness over many years he was not certain of the date but hecould not have been less than ten years old possibly twelve when it hadhappenedhis father had disappeared some time earlier how much earlier he couldnot remember he remembered better the rackety uneasy circumstances ofthe time the periodical panics about airraids and the sheltering in tubestations the piles of rubble everywhere the unintelligible proclamationsposted at street corners the gangs of youths in shirts all the samecolour the enormous queues outside the bakeries the intermittentmachinegun fire in the distanceabove all the fact that there wasnever enough to eat he remembered long afternoons spent with other boysin scrounging round dustbins and rubbish heaps picking out the ribs ofcabbage leaves potato peelings sometimes even scraps of stale breadcrustfrom which they carefully scraped away the cinders and also in waitingfor the passing of trucks which travelled over a certain route and wereknown to carry cattle feed and which when they jolted over the badpatches in the road sometimes spilt a few fragments of oilcakewhen his father disappeared his mother did not show any surprise or anyviolent grief but a sudden change came over her she seemed to havebecome completely spiritless it was evident even to winston that she waswaiting for something that she knew must happen she did everything thatwas neededcooked washed mended made the bed swept the floor dustedthe mantelpiecealways very slowly and with a curious lack of superfluousmotion like an artists layfigure moving of its own accord her largeshapely body seemed to relapse naturally into stillness for hours at atime she would sit almost immobile on the bed nursing his young sistera tiny ailing very silent child of two or three with a face made simianby thinness very occasionally she would take winston in her arms andpress him against her for a long time without saying anything he wasaware in spite of his youthfulness and selfishness that this was somehowconnected with the nevermentioned thing that was about to happenhe remembered the room where they lived a dark closesmelling room thatseemed half filled by a bed with a white counterpane there was a gas ringin the fender and a shelf where food was kept and on the landing outsidethere was a brown earthenware sink common to several rooms he rememberedhis mothers statuesque body bending over the gas ring to stir at somethingin a saucepan above all he remembered his continuous hunger and thefierce sordid battles at mealtimes he would ask his mother nagginglyover and over again why there was not more food he would shout and stormat her he even remembered the tones of his voice which was beginning tobreak prematurely and sometimes boomed in a peculiar way or he wouldattempt a snivelling note of pathos in his efforts to get more than hisshare his mother was quite ready to give him more than his share shetook it for granted that he the boy should have the biggest portionbut however much she gave him he invariably demanded more at every mealshe would beseech him not to be selfish and to remember that his littlesister was sick and also needed food but it was no use he would cry outwith rage when she stopped ladling he would try to wrench the saucepanand spoon out of her hands he would grab bits from his sisters platehe knew that he was starving the other two but he could not help it heeven felt that he had a right to do it the clamorous hunger in his bellyseemed to justify him between meals if his mother did not stand guardhe was constantly pilfering at the wretched store of food on the shelfone day a chocolate ration was issued there had been no such issue forweeks or months past he remembered quite clearly that precious littlemorsel of chocolate it was a twoounce slab they still talked aboutounces in those days between the three of them it was obvious that itought to be divided into three equal parts suddenly as though he werelistening to somebody else winston heard himself demanding in a loudbooming voice that he should be given the whole piece his mother told himnot to be greedy there was a long nagging argument that went round andround with shouts whines tears remonstrances bargainings his tinysister clinging to her mother with both hands exactly like a baby monkeysat looking over her shoulder at him with large mournful eyes in theend his mother broke off threequarters of the chocolate and gave it towinston giving the other quarter to his sister the little girl took holdof it and looked at it dully perhaps not knowing what it was winstonstood watching her for a moment then with a sudden swift spring he hadsnatched the piece of chocolate out of his sisters hand and was fleeingfor the doorwinston winston his mother called after him come back give yoursister back her chocolatehe stopped but did not come back his mothers anxious eyes were fixed onhis face even now he was thinking about the thing he did not know whatit was that was on the point of happening his sister conscious of havingbeen robbed of something had set up a feeble wail his mother drew herarm round the child and pressed its face against her breast something inthe gesture told him that his sister was dying he turned and fled downthe stairs with the chocolate growing sticky in his handhe never saw his mother again after he had devoured the chocolate he feltsomewhat ashamed of himself and hung about in the streets for severalhours until hunger drove him home when he came back his mother haddisappeared this was already becoming normal at that time nothing wasgone from the room except his mother and his sister they had not takenany clothes not even his mothers overcoat to this day he did not knowwith any certainty that his mother was dead it was perfectly possiblethat she had merely been sent to a forcedlabour camp as for his sistershe might have been removed like winston himself to one of the coloniesfor homeless children reclamation centres they were called which hadgrown up as a result of the civil war or she might have been sent to thelabour camp along with his mother or simply left somewhere or otherto diethe dream was still vivid in his mind especially the enveloping protectinggesture of the arm in which its whole meaning seemed to be contained hismind went back to another dream of two months ago exactly as his motherhad sat on the dingy whitequilted bed with the child clinging to her soshe had sat in the sunken ship far underneath him and drowning deeperevery minute but still looking up at him through the darkening waterhe told julia the story of his mothers disappearance without opening hereyes she rolled over and settled herself into a more comfortable positioni expect you were a beastly little swine in those days she saidindistinctly all children are swineyes but the real point of the storyfrom her breathing it was evident that she was going off to sleep againhe would have liked to continue talking about his mother he did notsuppose from what he could remember of her that she had been an unusualwoman still less an intelligent one and yet she had possessed a kind ofnobility a kind of purity simply because the standards that she obeyedwere private ones her feelings were her own and could not be alteredfrom outside it would not have occurred to her that an action which isineffectual thereby becomes meaningless if you loved someone you lovedhim and when you had nothing else to give you still gave him love whenthe last of the chocolate was gone his mother had clasped the child inher arms it was no use it changed nothing it did not produce morechocolate it did not avert the childs death or her own but it seemednatural to her to do it the refugee woman in the boat had also coveredthe little boy with her arm which was no more use against the bulletsthan a sheet of paper the terrible thing that the party had done was topersuade you that mere impulses mere feelings were of no account whileat the same time robbing you of all power over the material world whenonce you were in the grip of the party what you felt or did not feelwhat you did or refrained from doing made literally no differencewhatever happened you vanished and neither you nor your actions were everheard of again you were lifted clean out of the stream of history andyet to the people of only two generations ago this would not have seemedallimportant because they were not attempting to alter history theywere governed by private loyalties which they did not question whatmattered were individual relationships and a completely helpless gesturean embrace a tear a word spoken to a dying man could have value initself the proles it suddenly occurred to him had remained in thiscondition they were not loyal to a party or a country or an idea theywere loyal to one another for the first time in his life he did notdespise the proles or think of them merely as an inert force which wouldone day spring to life and regenerate the world the proles had stayedhuman they had not become hardened inside they had held on to theprimitive emotions which he himself had to relearn by conscious effortand in thinking this he remembered without apparent relevance how a fewweeks ago he had seen a severed hand lying on the pavement and had kickedit into the gutter as though it had been a cabbagestalkthe proles are human beings he said aloud we are not humanwhy not said julia who had woken up againhe thought for a little while has it ever occurred to you he saidthat the best thing for us to do would be simply to walk out of herebefore its too late and never see each other againyes dear it has occurred to me several times but im not going to doit all the sameweve been lucky he said but it cant last much longer youre youngyou look normal and innocent if you keep clear of people like me youmight stay alive for another fifty yearsno ive thought it all out what you do im going to do and dont betoo downhearted im rather good at staying alivewe may be together for another six monthsa yeartheres no knowingat the end were certain to be apart do you realize how utterly alone weshall be when once they get hold of us there will be nothing literallynothing that either of us can do for the other if i confess theyllshoot you and if i refuse to confess theyll shoot you just the samenothing that i can do or say or stop myself from saying will put offyour death for as much as five minutes neither of us will even knowwhether the other is alive or dead we shall be utterly without power ofany kind the one thing that matters is that we shouldnt betray oneanother although even that cant make the slightest differenceif you mean confessing she said we shall do that right enougheverybody always confesses you cant help it they torture youi dont mean confessing confession is not betrayal what you say or dodoesnt matter only feelings matter if they could make me stop lovingyouthat would be the real betrayalshe thought it over they cant do that she said finally its the onething they cant do they can make you say anythinganythingbut theycant make you believe it they cant get inside youno he said a little more hopefully no thats quite true they cantget inside you if you can feel that staying human is worth while evenwhen it cant have any result whatever youve beaten themhe thought of the telescreen with its neversleeping ear they could spyupon you night and day but if you kept your head you could still outwitthem with all their cleverness they had never mastered the secret offinding out what another human being was thinking perhaps that was lesstrue when you were actually in their hands one did not know what happenedinside the ministry of love but it was possible to guess tortures drugsdelicate instruments that registered your nervous reactions gradualwearingdown by sleeplessness and solitude and persistent questioningfacts at any rate could not be kept hidden they could be tracked downby enquiry they could be squeezed out of you by torture but if the objectwas not to stay alive but to stay human what difference did it ultimatelymake they could not alter your feelings for that matter you could notalter them yourself even if you wanted to they could lay bare in theutmost detail everything that you had done or said or thought but theinner heart whose workings were mysterious even to yourself remainedimpregnablechapter they had done it they had done it at lastthe room they were standing in was longshaped and softly lit thetelescreen was dimmed to a low murmur the richness of the darkblue carpetgave one the impression of treading on velvet at the far end of the roomobrien was sitting at a table under a greenshaded lamp with a mass ofpapers on either side of him he had not bothered to look up when theservant showed julia and winston inwinstons heart was thumping so hard that he doubted whether he would beable to speak they had done it they had done it at last was all hecould think it had been a rash act to come here at all and sheer follyto arrive together though it was true that they had come by differentroutes and only met on obriens doorstep but merely to walk into such aplace needed an effort of the nerve it was only on very rare occasionsthat one saw inside the dwellingplaces of the inner party or evenpenetrated into the quarter of the town where they lived the wholeatmosphere of the huge block of flats the richness and spaciousness ofeverything the unfamiliar smells of good food and good tobacco thesilent and incredibly rapid lifts sliding up and down the whitejacketedservants hurrying to and froeverything was intimidating although he hada good pretext for coming here he was haunted at every step by the fearthat a blackuniformed guard would suddenly appear from round the cornerdemand his papers and order him to get out obriens servant howeverhad admitted the two of them without demur he was a small darkhairedman in a white jacket with a diamondshaped completely expressionlessface which might have been that of a chinese the passage down which heled them was softly carpeted with creampapered walls and whitewainscoting all exquisitely clean that too was intimidating winstoncould not remember ever to have seen a passageway whose walls were notgrimy from the contact of human bodiesobrien had a slip of paper between his fingers and seemed to be studyingit intently his heavy face bent down so that one could see the line ofthe nose looked both formidable and intelligent for perhaps twentyseconds he sat without stirring then he pulled the speakwrite towardshim and rapped out a message in the hybrid jargon of the ministriesitems one comma five comma seven approved fullwise stop suggestioncontained item six doubleplus ridiculous verging crimethink cancel stopunproceed constructionwise antegetting plusfull estimates machineryoverheads stop end messagehe rose deliberately from his chair and came towards them across thesoundless carpet a little of the official atmosphere seemed to have fallenaway from him with the newspeak words but his expression was grimmer thanusual as though he were not pleased at being disturbed the terror thatwinston already felt was suddenly shot through by a streak of ordinaryembarrassment it seemed to him quite possible that he had simply made astupid mistake for what evidence had he in reality that obrien was anykind of political conspirator nothing but a flash of the eyes and a singleequivocal remark beyond that only his own secret imaginings founded ona dream he could not even fall back on the pretence that he had come toborrow the dictionary because in that case julias presence was impossibleto explain as obrien passed the telescreen a thought seemed to strikehim he stopped turned aside and pressed a switch on the wall there wasa sharp snap the voice had stoppedjulia uttered a tiny sound a sort of squeak of surprise even in the midstof his panic winston was too much taken aback to be able to hold histongueyou can turn it off he saidyes said obrien we can turn it off we have that privilegehe was opposite them now his solid form towered over the pair of themand the expression on his face was still indecipherable he was waitingsomewhat sternly for winston to speak but about what even now it wasquite conceivable that he was simply a busy man wondering irritably why hehad been interrupted nobody spoke after the stopping of the telescreenthe room seemed deadly silent the seconds marched past enormous withdifficulty winston continued to keep his eyes fixed on obriens thensuddenly the grim face broke down into what might have been the beginningsof a smile with his characteristic gesture obrien resettled hisspectacles on his noseshall i say it or will you he saidi will say it said winston promptly that thing is really turned offyes everything is turned off we are alonewe have come here becausehe paused realizing for the first time the vagueness ofhis own motives since he did not in fact know what kind ofhelp he expected from obrien it was not easy to say why hehad come here he went on conscious that what he was sayingmust sound both feeble and pretentiouswe believe that there is some kind of conspiracy some kind of secretorganization working against the party and that you are involved in itwe want to join it and work for it we are enemies of the party wedisbelieve in the principles of ingsoc we are thoughtcriminals we arealso adulterers i tell you this because we want to put ourselves at yourmercy if you want us to incriminate ourselves in any other way we arereadyhe stopped and glanced over his shoulder with the feeling that the doorhad opened sure enough the little yellowfaced servant had come inwithout knocking winston saw that he was carrying a tray with a decanterand glassesmartin is one of us said obrien impassively bring the drinks overhere martin put them on the round table have we enough chairs thenwe may as well sit down and talk in comfort bring a chair for yourselfmartin this is business you can stop being a servant for the next tenminutesthe little man sat down quite at his ease and yet still with aservantlike air the air of a valet enjoying a privilege winstonregarded him out of the corner of his eye it struck him that the manswhole life was playing a part and that he felt it to be dangerous todrop his assumed personality even for a moment obrien took the decanterby the neck and filled up the glasses with a darkred liquid it arousedin winston dim memories of something seen long ago on a wall or ahoardinga vast bottle composed of electric lights which seemed to moveup and down and pour its contents into a glass seen from the top thestuff looked almost black but in the decanter it gleamed like a rubyit had a soursweet smell he saw julia pick up her glass and sniff atit with frank curiosityit is called wine said obrien with a faint smile you will have readabout it in books no doubt not much of it gets to the outer party i amafraid his face grew solemn again and he raised his glass i think itis fitting that we should begin by drinking a health to our leader toemmanuel goldsteinwinston took up his glass with a certain eagerness wine was a thing hehad read and dreamed about like the glass paperweight or mr charringtonshalfremembered rhymes it belonged to the vanished romantic past theolden time as he liked to call it in his secret thoughts for some reasonhe had always thought of wine as having an intensely sweet taste likethat of blackberry jam and an immediate intoxicating effect actuallywhen he came to swallow it the stuff was distinctly disappointing thetruth was that after years of gindrinking he could barely taste it heset down the empty glassthen there is such a person as goldstein he saidyes there is such a person and he is alive where i do not knowand the conspiracythe organization is it real it is not simply aninvention of the thought policeno it is real the brotherhood we call it you will never learn muchmore about the brotherhood than that it exists and that you belong to iti will come back to that presently he looked at his wristwatch it isunwise even for members of the inner party to turn off the telescreen formore than half an hour you ought not to have come here together andyou will have to leave separately you comradehe bowed his head tojuliawill leave first we have about twenty minutes at our disposalyou will understand that i must start by asking you certain questionsin general terms what are you prepared to doanything that we are capable of said winstonobrien had turned himself a little in his chair so that he was facingwinston he almost ignored julia seeming to take it for granted thatwinston could speak for her for a moment the lids flitted down over hiseyes he began asking his questions in a low expressionless voice asthough this were a routine a sort of catechism most of whose answerswere known to him alreadyyou are prepared to give your livesyesyou are prepared to commit murderyesto commit acts of sabotage which may cause the death of hundreds ofinnocent peopleyesto betray your country to foreign powersyesyou are prepared to cheat to forge to blackmail to corrupt the mindsof children to distribute habitforming drugs to encourage prostitutionto disseminate venereal diseasesto do anything which is likely to causedemoralization and weaken the power of the partyyesif for example it would somehow serve our interests to throw sulphuricacid in a childs faceare you prepared to do thatyesyou are prepared to lose your identity and live out the rest of your lifeas a waiter or a dockworkeryesyou are prepared to commit suicide if and when we order you to do soyesyou are prepared the two of you to separate and never see one anotheragainno broke in juliait appeared to winston that a long time passed before he answered for amoment he seemed even to have been deprived of the power of speech histongue worked soundlessly forming the opening syllables first of one wordthen of the other over and over again until he had said it he did notknow which word he was going to say no he said finallyyou did well to tell me said obrien it is necessary for us to knoweverythinghe turned himself toward julia and added in a voice with somewhat moreexpression in itdo you understand that even if he survives it may be as a differentperson we may be obliged to give him a new identity his face hismovements the shape of his hands the colour of his haireven his voicewould be different and you yourself might have become a different personour surgeons can alter people beyond recognition sometimes it isnecessary sometimes we even amputate a limbwinston could not help snatching another sidelong glance at martinsmongolian face there were no scars that he could see julia had turned ashade paler so that her freckles were showing but she faced obrienboldly she murmured something that seemed to be assentgood then that is settledthere was a silver box of cigarettes on the table with a ratherabsentminded air obrien pushed them towards the others took one himselfthen stood up and began to pace slowly to and fro as though he could thinkbetter standing they were very good cigarettes very thick andwellpacked with an unfamiliar silkiness in the paper obrien looked athis wristwatch againyou had better go back to your pantry martin he said i shall switchon in a quarter of an hour take a good look at these comrades facesbefore you go you will be seeing them again i may notexactly as they had done at the front door the little mans dark eyesflickered over their faces there was not a trace of friendliness in hismanner he was memorizing their appearance but he felt no interest inthem or appeared to feel none it occurred to winston that a syntheticface was perhaps incapable of changing its expression without speakingor giving any kind of salutation martin went out closing the doorsilently behind him obrien was strolling up and down one hand in thepocket of his black overalls the other holding his cigaretteyou understand he said that you will be fighting in the dark youwill always be in the dark you will receive orders and you will obey themwithout knowing why later i shall send you a book from which you willlearn the true nature of the society we live in and the strategy by whichwe shall destroy it when you have read the book you will be full membersof the brotherhood but between the general aims that we are fighting forand the immediate tasks of the moment you will never know anything itell you that the brotherhood exists but i cannot tell you whether itnumbers a hundred members or ten million from your personal knowledgeyou will never be able to say that it numbers even as many as a dozen youwill have three or four contacts who will be renewed from time to time asthey disappear as this was your first contact it will be preserved whenyou receive orders they will come from me if we find it necessary tocommunicate with you it will be through martin when you are finallycaught you will confess that is unavoidable but you will have verylittle to confess other than your own actions you will not be able tobetray more than a handful of unimportant people probably you will noteven betray me by that time i may be dead or i shall have become adifferent person with a different facehe continued to move to and fro over the soft carpet in spite of thebulkiness of his body there was a remarkable grace in his movements itcame out even in the gesture with which he thrust a hand into his pocketor manipulated a cigarette more even than of strength he gave animpression of confidence and of an understanding tinged by irony howevermuch in earnest he might be he had nothing of the singlemindedness thatbelongs to a fanatic when he spoke of murder suicide venereal diseaseamputated limbs and altered faces it was with a faint air of persiflagethis is unavoidable his voice seemed to say this is what we have gotto do unflinchingly but this is not what we shall be doing when life isworth living again a wave of admiration almost of worship flowed outfrom winston towards obrien for the moment he had forgotten the shadowyfigure of goldstein when you looked at obriens powerful shoulders andhis bluntfeatured face so ugly and yet so civilized it was impossibleto believe that he could be defeated there was no stratagem that he wasnot equal to no danger that he could not foresee even julia seemed tobe impressed she had let her cigarette go out and was listening intentlyobrien went onyou will have heard rumours of the existence of the brotherhood no doubtyou have formed your own picture of it you have imagined probably ahuge underworld of conspirators meeting secretly in cellars scribblingmessages on walls recognizing one another by codewords or by specialmovements of the hand nothing of the kind exists the members of thebrotherhood have no way of recognizing one another and it is impossiblefor any one member to be aware of the identity of more than a few othersgoldstein himself if he fell into the hands of the thought police couldnot give them a complete list of members or any information that wouldlead them to a complete list no such list exists the brotherhood cannotbe wiped out because it is not an organization in the ordinary sensenothing holds it together except an idea which is indestructible youwill never have anything to sustain you except the idea you will get nocomradeship and no encouragement when finally you are caught you willget no help we never help our members at most when it is absolutelynecessary that someone should be silenced we are occasionally able tosmuggle a razor blade into a prisoners cell you will have to get usedto living without results and without hope you will work for a whileyou will be caught you will confess and then you will die those arethe only results that you will ever see there is no possibility that anyperceptible change will happen within our own lifetime we are the deadour only true life is in the future we shall take part in it as handfulsof dust and splinters of bone but how far away that future may be thereis no knowing it might be a thousand years at present nothing is possibleexcept to extend the area of sanity little by little we cannot actcollectively we can only spread our knowledge outwards from individual toindividual generation after generation in the face of the thought policethere is no other wayhe halted and looked for the third time at his wristwatchit is almost time for you to leave comrade he said to julia waitthe decanter is still half fullhe filled the glasses and raised his own glass by the stemwhat shall it be this time he said still with the same faintsuggestion of irony to the confusion of the thought police to thedeath of big brother to humanity to the futureto the past said winstonthe past is more important agreed obrien gravelythey emptied their glasses and a moment later julia stood up to goobrien took a small box from the top of a cabinet and handed her a flatwhite tablet which he told her to place on her tongue it was importanthe said not to go out smelling of wine the lift attendants were veryobservant as soon as the door had shut behind her he appeared to forgether existence he took another pace or two up and down then stoppedthere are details to be settled he said i assume that you have ahidingplace of some kindwinston explained about the room over mr charringtons shopthat will do for the moment later we will arrange something else for youit is important to change ones hidingplace frequently meanwhile i shallsend you a copy of the bookeven obrien winston noticed seemed topronounce the words as though they were in italicsgoldsteins book youunderstand as soon as possible it may be some days before i can get holdof one there are not many in existence as you can imagine the thoughtpolice hunt them down and destroy them almost as fast as we can producethem it makes very little difference the book is indestructible ifthe last copy were gone we could reproduce it almost word for word doyou carry a briefcase to work with you he addedas a rule yeswhat is it likeblack very shabby with two strapsblack two straps very shabbygood one day in the fairly nearfuturei cannot give a dateone of the messages among your morningswork will contain a misprinted word and you will have to ask for arepeat on the following day you will go to work without your briefcaseat some time during the day in the street a man will touch you on thearm and say i think you have dropped your briefcase the one he givesyou will contain a copy of goldsteins book you will return it withinfourteen daysthey were silent for a momentthere are a couple of minutes before you need go said obrien weshall meet againif we do meet againwinston looked up at him in the place where there is no darknesshe said hesitantlyobrien nodded without appearance of surprise in the place where thereis no darkness he said as though he had recognized the allusion andin the meantime is there anything that you wish to say before you leaveany message any questionwinston thought there did not seem to be any further question that hewanted to ask still less did he feel any impulse to utter highsoundinggeneralities instead of anything directly connected with obrien or thebrotherhood there came into his mind a sort of composite picture of thedark bedroom where his mother had spent her last days and the little roomover mr charringtons shop and the glass paperweight and the steelengraving in its rosewood frame almost at random he saiddid you ever happen to hear an old rhyme that begins oranges and lemonssay the bells of st clementsagain obrien nodded with a sort of grave courtesy he completed thestanza  oranges and lemons say the bells of st clements  you owe me three farthings say the bells of st martins  when will you pay me say the bells of old bailey  when i grow rich say the bells of shoreditchyou knew the last line said winstonyes i knew the last line and now i am afraid it is time for you to gobut wait you had better let me give you one of these tabletsas winston stood up obrien held out a hand his powerful grip crushedthe bones of winstons palm at the door winston looked back but obrienseemed already to be in process of putting him out of mind he was waitingwith his hand on the switch that controlled the telescreen beyond himwinston could see the writingtable with its greenshaded lamp and thespeakwrite and the wire baskets deepladen with papers the incident wasclosed within thirty seconds it occurred to him obrien would be backat his interrupted and important work on behalf of the partychapter winston was gelatinous with fatigue gelatinous was the right word it hadcome into his head spontaneously his body seemed to have not only theweakness of a jelly but its translucency he felt that if he held up hishand he would be able to see the light through it all the blood andlymph had been drained out of him by an enormous debauch of work leavingonly a frail structure of nerves bones and skin all sensations seemedto be magnified his overalls fretted his shoulders the pavement tickledhis feet even the opening and closing of a hand was an effort that madehis joints creakhe had worked more than ninety hours in five days so had everyone else inthe ministry now it was all over and he had literally nothing to do noparty work of any description until tomorrow morning he could spend sixhours in the hidingplace and another nine in his own bed slowly inmild afternoon sunshine he walked up a dingy street in the directionof mr charringtons shop keeping one eye open for the patrols butirrationally convinced that this afternoon there was no danger of anyoneinterfering with him the heavy briefcase that he was carrying bumpedagainst his knee at each step sending a tingling sensation up and downthe skin of his leg inside it was the book which he had now had in hispossession for six days and had not yet opened nor even looked aton the sixth day of hate week after the processions the speeches theshouting the singing the banners the posters the films the waxworksthe rolling of drums and squealing of trumpets the tramp of marching feetthe grinding of the caterpillars of tanks the roar of massed planesthe booming of gunsafter six days of this when the great orgasm wasquivering to its climax and the general hatred of eurasia had boiled upinto such delirium that if the crowd could have got their hands on the eurasian warcriminals who were to be publicly hanged on the lastday of the proceedings they would unquestionably have torn them topiecesat just this moment it had been announced that oceania was notafter all at war with eurasia oceania was at war with eastasia eurasiawas an allythere was of course no admission that any change had taken place merelyit became known with extreme suddenness and everywhere at once thateastasia and not eurasia was the enemy winston was taking part in ademonstration in one of the central london squares at the moment when ithappened it was night and the white faces and the scarlet banners wereluridly floodlit the square was packed with several thousand peopleincluding a block of about a thousand schoolchildren in the uniform of thespies on a scarletdraped platform an orator of the inner party a smalllean man with disproportionately long arms and a large bald skull overwhich a few lank locks straggled was haranguing the crowd a littlerumpelstiltskin figure contorted with hatred he gripped the neck of themicrophone with one hand while the other enormous at the end of a bonyarm clawed the air menacingly above his head his voice made metallic bythe amplifiers boomed forth an endless catalogue of atrocities massacresdeportations lootings rapings torture of prisoners bombing ofcivilians lying propaganda unjust aggressions broken treaties it wasalmost impossible to listen to him without being first convinced and thenmaddened at every few moments the fury of the crowd boiled over and thevoice of the speaker was drowned by a wild beastlike roaring that roseuncontrollably from thousands of throats the most savage yells of allcame from the schoolchildren the speech had been proceeding for perhapstwenty minutes when a messenger hurried on to the platform and a scrap ofpaper was slipped into the speakers hand he unrolled and read it withoutpausing in his speech nothing altered in his voice or manner or in thecontent of what he was saying but suddenly the names were differentwithout words said a wave of understanding rippled through the crowdoceania was at war with eastasia the next moment there was a tremendouscommotion the banners and posters with which the square was decoratedwere all wrong quite half of them had the wrong faces on them it wassabotage the agents of goldstein had been at work there was a riotousinterlude while posters were ripped from the walls banners torn to shredsand trampled underfoot the spies performed prodigies of activity inclambering over the rooftops and cutting the streamers that fluttered fromthe chimneys but within two or three minutes it was all over the oratorstill gripping the neck of the microphone his shoulders hunched forwardhis free hand clawing at the air had gone straight on with his speechone minute more and the feral roars of rage were again bursting from thecrowd the hate continued exactly as before except that the target hadbeen changedthe thing that impressed winston in looking back was that the speaker hadswitched from one line to the other actually in midsentence not onlywithout a pause but without even breaking the syntax but at the momenthe had other things to preoccupy him it was during the moment of disorderwhile the posters were being torn down that a man whose face he did notsee had tapped him on the shoulder and said excuse me i think youvedropped your briefcase he took the briefcase abstractedly withoutspeaking he knew that it would be days before he had an opportunity tolook inside it the instant that the demonstration was over he wentstraight to the ministry of truth though the time was now nearlytwentythree hours the entire staff of the ministry had done likewisethe orders already issuing from the telescreen recalling them to theirposts were hardly necessaryoceania was at war with eastasia oceania had always been at war witheastasia a large part of the political literature of five years was nowcompletely obsolete reports and records of all kinds newspapers bookspamphlets films soundtracks photographsall had to be rectified atlightning speed although no directive was ever issued it was known thatthe chiefs of the department intended that within one week no referenceto the war with eurasia or the alliance with eastasia should remain inexistence anywhere the work was overwhelming all the more so becausethe processes that it involved could not be called by their truenames everyone in the records department worked eighteen hours in thetwentyfour with two threehour snatches of sleep mattresses were broughtup from the cellars and pitched all over the corridors meals consisted ofsandwiches and victory coffee wheeled round on trolleys by attendants fromthe canteen each time that winston broke off for one of his spells ofsleep he tried to leave his desk clear of work and each time that hecrawled back stickyeyed and aching it was to find that another showerof paper cylinders had covered the desk like a snowdrift halfburying thespeakwrite and overflowing on to the floor so that the first job wasalways to stack them into a neat enough pile to give him room to workwhat was worst of all was that the work was by no means purely mechanicaloften it was enough merely to substitute one name for another but anydetailed report of events demanded care and imagination even thegeographical knowledge that one needed in transferring the war from onepart of the world to another was considerableby the third day his eyes ached unbearably and his spectacles needed wipingevery few minutes it was like struggling with some crushing physical tasksomething which one had the right to refuse and which one was neverthelessneurotically anxious to accomplish in so far as he had time to rememberit he was not troubled by the fact that every word he murmured into thespeakwrite every stroke of his inkpencil was a deliberate lie he wasas anxious as anyone else in the department that the forgery should beperfect on the morning of the sixth day the dribble of cylinders sloweddown for as much as half an hour nothing came out of the tube then onemore cylinder then nothing everywhere at about the same time the workwas easing off a deep and as it were secret sigh went through thedepartment a mighty deed which could never be mentioned had beenachieved it was now impossible for any human being to prove by documentaryevidence that the war with eurasia had ever happened at twelve hundred itwas unexpectedly announced that all workers in the ministry were free tilltomorrow morning winston still carrying the briefcase containing thebook which had remained between his feet while he worked and under hisbody while he slept went home shaved himself and almost fell asleep inhis bath although the water was barely more than tepidwith a sort of voluptuous creaking in his joints he climbed the stair abovemr charringtons shop he was tired but not sleepy any longer he openedthe window lit the dirty little oilstove and put on a pan of water forcoffee julia would arrive presently meanwhile there was the book hesat down in the sluttish armchair and undid the straps of the briefcasea heavy black volume amateurishly bound with no name or title on thecover the print also looked slightly irregular the pages were worn atthe edges and fell apart easily as though the book had passed throughmany hands the inscription on the titlepage ran  the theory and practice of  oligarchical collectivism  by  emmanuel goldsteinwinston began readingchapter iignorance is strengththroughout recorded time and probably since the end of the neolithic agethere have been three kinds of people in the world the high the middleand the low they have been subdivided in many ways they have bornecountless different names and their relative numbers as well as theirattitude towards one another have varied from age to age but theessential structure of society has never altered even after enormousupheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes the same pattern has alwaysreasserted itself just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibriumhowever far it is pushed one way or the otherthe aims of these groups are entirely irreconcilablewinston stopped reading chiefly in order to appreciate the fact that hewas reading in comfort and safety he was alone no telescreen no ear atthe keyhole no nervous impulse to glance over his shoulder or cover thepage with his hand the sweet summer air played against his cheek fromsomewhere far away there floated the faint shouts of children in the roomitself there was no sound except the insect voice of the clock he settleddeeper into the armchair and put his feet up on the fender it was blissit was eternity suddenly as one sometimes does with a book of which oneknows that one will ultimately read and reread every word he opened itat a different place and found himself at chapter iii he went on readingchapter iiiwar is peacethe splitting up of the world into three great superstates was an eventwhich could be and indeed was foreseen before the middle of the twentiethcentury with the absorption of europe by russia and of the british empireby the united states two of the three existing powers eurasia andoceania were already effectively in being the third eastasia onlyemerged as a distinct unit after another decade of confused fighting thefrontiers between the three superstates are in some places arbitrary andin others they fluctuate according to the fortunes of war but in generalthey follow geographical lines eurasia comprises the whole of the northernpart of the european and asiatic landmass from portugal to the beringstrait oceania comprises the americas the atlantic islands including thebritish isles australasia and the southern portion of africa eastasiasmaller than the others and with a less definite western frontiercomprises china and the countries to the south of it the japanese islandsand a large but fluctuating portion of manchuria mongolia and tibetin one combination or another these three superstates are permanently atwar and have been so for the past twentyfive years war however is nolonger the desperate annihilating struggle that it was in the earlydecades of the twentieth century it is a warfare of limited aims betweencombatants who are unable to destroy one another have no material causefor fighting and are not divided by any genuine ideological differencethis is not to say that either the conduct of war or the prevailingattitude towards it has become less bloodthirsty or more chivalrouson the contrary war hysteria is continuous and universal in all countriesand such acts as raping looting the slaughter of children the reductionof whole populations to slavery and reprisals against prisoners whichextend even to boiling and burying alive are looked upon as normaland when they are committed by ones own side and not by the enemymeritorious but in a physical sense war involves very small numbers ofpeople mostly highlytrained specialists and causes comparatively fewcasualties the fighting when there is any takes place on the vaguefrontiers whose whereabouts the average man can only guess at or roundthe floating fortresses which guard strategic spots on the sea lanes inthe centres of civilization war means no more than a continuous shortageof consumption goods and the occasional crash of a rocket bomb which maycause a few scores of deaths war has in fact changed its character moreexactly the reasons for which war is waged have changed in their order ofimportance motives which were already present to some small extent in thegreat wars of the early twentieth century have now become dominant andare consciously recognized and acted uponto understand the nature of the present warfor in spite of the regroupingwhich occurs every few years it is always the same warone must realizein the first place that it is impossible for it to be decisive none ofthe three superstates could be definitively conquered even by the othertwo in combination they are too evenly matched and their natural defencesare too formidable eurasia is protected by its vast land spaces oceaniaby the width of the atlantic and the pacific eastasia by the fecundityand industriousness of its inhabitants secondly there is no longer ina material sense anything to fight about with the establishment ofselfcontained economies in which production and consumption are gearedto one another the scramble for markets which was a main cause ofprevious wars has come to an end while the competition for raw materialsis no longer a matter of life and death in any case each of the threesuperstates is so vast that it can obtain almost all the materials thatit needs within its own boundaries in so far as the war has a directeconomic purpose it is a war for labour power between the frontiers ofthe superstates and not permanently in the possession of any of themthere lies a rough quadrilateral with its corners at tangier brazzavilledarwin and hong kong containing within it about a fifth of the populationof the earth it is for the possession of these thicklypopulated regionsand of the northern icecap that the three powers are constantlystruggling in practice no one power ever controls the whole of thedisputed area portions of it are constantly changing hands and it is thechance of seizing this or that fragment by a sudden stroke of treacherythat dictates the endless changes of alignmentall of the disputed territories contain valuable minerals and some ofthem yield important vegetable products such as rubber which in colderclimates it is necessary to synthesize by comparatively expensive methodsbut above all they contain a bottomless reserve of cheap labour whicheverpower controls equatorial africa or the countries of the middle east orsouthern india or the indonesian archipelago disposes also of the bodiesof scores or hundreds of millions of illpaid and hardworking cooliesthe inhabitants of these areas reduced more or less openly to the statusof slaves pass continually from conqueror to conqueror and are expendedlike so much coal or oil in the race to turn out more armaments to capturemore territory to control more labour power to turn out more armamentsto capture more territory and so on indefinitely it should be noted thatthe fighting never really moves beyond the edges of the disputed areasthe frontiers of eurasia flow back and forth between the basin of the congoand the northern shore of the mediterranean the islands of the indianocean and the pacific are constantly being captured and recaptured byoceania or by eastasia in mongolia the dividing line between eurasia andeastasia is never stable round the pole all three powers lay claim toenormous territories which in fact are largely uninhabited and unexploredbut the balance of power always remains roughly even and the territorywhich forms the heartland of each superstate always remains inviolatemoreover the labour of the exploited peoples round the equator is notreally necessary to the worlds economy they add nothing to the wealth ofthe world since whatever they produce is used for purposes of war andthe object of waging a war is always to be in a better position in whichto wage another war by their labour the slave populations allow the tempoof continuous warfare to be speeded up but if they did not exist thestructure of world society and the process by which it maintains itselfwould not be essentially differentthe primary aim of modern warfare in accordance with the principles ofdoublethink this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized bythe directing brains of the inner party is to use up the products of themachine without raising the general standard of living ever since the endof the nineteenth century the problem of what to do with the surplus ofconsumption goods has been latent in industrial society at present whenfew human beings even have enough to eat this problem is obviously noturgent and it might not have become so even if no artificial processesof destruction had been at work the world of today is a bare hungrydilapidated place compared with the world that existed before  andstill more so if compared with the imaginary future to which the people ofthat period looked forward in the early twentieth century the vision ofa future society unbelievably rich leisured orderly and efficientaglittering antiseptic world of glass and steel and snowwhite concretewaspart of the consciousness of nearly every literate person science andtechnology were developing at a prodigious speed and it seemed natural toassume that they would go on developing this failed to happen partlybecause of the impoverishment caused by a long series of wars andrevolutions partly because scientific and technical progress depended onthe empirical habit of thought which could not survive in a strictlyregimented society as a whole the world is more primitive today than itwas fifty years ago certain backward areas have advanced and variousdevices always in some way connected with warfare and police espionagehave been developed but experiment and invention have largely stoppedand the ravages of the atomic war of the nineteenfifties have never beenfully repaired nevertheless the dangers inherent in the machine are stillthere from the moment when the machine first made its appearance itwas clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery andtherefore to a great extent for human inequality had disappeared if themachine were used deliberately for that end hunger overwork dirtilliteracy and disease could be eliminated within a few generationsand in fact without being used for any such purpose but by a sort ofautomatic processby producing wealth which it was sometimes impossiblenot to distributethe machine did raise the living standards of theaverage human being very greatly over a period of about fifty years atthe end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuriesbut it was also clear that an allround increase in wealth threatened thedestructionindeed in some sense was the destructionof a hierarchicalsociety in a world in which everyone worked short hours had enough toeat lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator and possesseda motorcar or even an aeroplane the most obvious and perhaps the mostimportant form of inequality would already have disappeared if it oncebecame general wealth would confer no distinction it was possible nodoubt to imagine a society in which wealth in the sense of personalpossessions and luxuries should be evenly distributed while powerremained in the hands of a small privileged caste but in practice sucha society could not long remain stable for if leisure and security wereenjoyed by all alike the great mass of human beings who are normallystupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think forthemselves and when once they had done this they would sooner or laterrealize that the privileged minority had no function and they would sweepit away in the long run a hierarchical society was only possible on abasis of poverty and ignorance to return to the agricultural past assome thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed ofdoing was not a practicable solution it conflicted with the tendencytowards mechanization which had become quasiinstinctive throughout almostthe whole world and moreover any country which remained industriallybackward was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominateddirectly or indirectly by its more advanced rivalsnor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in poverty byrestricting the output of goods this happened to a great extent duringthe final phase of capitalism roughly between  and  the economyof many countries was allowed to stagnate land went out of cultivationcapital equipment was not added to great blocks of the population wereprevented from working and kept half alive by state charity but thistoo entailed military weakness and since the privations it inflictedwere obviously unnecessary it made opposition inevitable the problem washow to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the realwealth of the world goods must be produced but they must not bedistributed and in practice the only way of achieving this was bycontinuous warfarethe essential act of war is destruction not necessarily of human livesbut of the products of human labour war is a way of shattering to piecesor pouring into the stratosphere or sinking in the depths of the seamaterials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortableand hence in the long run too intelligent even when weapons of war arenot actually destroyed their manufacture is still a convenient way ofexpending labour power without producing anything that can be consumeda floating fortress for example has locked up in it the labour thatwould build several hundred cargoships ultimately it is scrapped asobsolete never having brought any material benefit to anybody and withfurther enormous labours another floating fortress is built in principlethe war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that mightexist after meeting the bare needs of the population in practice the needsof the population are always underestimated with the result that there isa chronic shortage of half the necessities of life but this is looked onas an advantage it is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groupssomewhere near the brink of hardship because a general state of scarcityincreases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies thedistinction between one group and another by the standards of the earlytwentieth century even a member of the inner party lives an austerelaborious kind of life nevertheless the few luxuries that he does enjoyhis large wellappointed flat the better texture of his clothes thebetter quality of his food and drink and tobacco his two or threeservants his private motorcar or helicopterset him in a different worldfrom a member of the outer party and the members of the outer party havea similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we callthe proles the social atmosphere is that of a besieged city where thepossession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth andpoverty and at the same time the consciousness of being at war andtherefore in danger makes the handingover of all power to a small casteseem the natural unavoidable condition of survivalwar it will be seen accomplishes the necessary destruction butaccomplishes it in a psychologically acceptable way in principle it wouldbe quite simple to waste the surplus labour of the world by buildingtemples and pyramids by digging holes and filling them up again or evenby producing vast quantities of goods and then setting fire to them butthis would provide only the economic and not the emotional basis for ahierarchical society what is concerned here is not the morale of masseswhose attitude is unimportant so long as they are kept steadily at workbut the morale of the party itself even the humblest party member isexpected to be competent industrious and even intelligent within narrowlimits but it is also necessary that he should be a credulous and ignorantfanatic whose prevailing moods are fear hatred adulation and orgiastictriumph in other words it is necessary that he should have the mentalityappropriate to a state of war it does not matter whether the war isactually happening and since no decisive victory is possible it doesnot matter whether the war is going well or badly all that is needed isthat a state of war should exist the splitting of the intelligence whichthe party requires of its members and which is more easily achieved in anatmosphere of war is now almost universal but the higher up the ranksone goes the more marked it becomes it is precisely in the inner partythat war hysteria and hatred of the enemy are strongest in his capacityas an administrator it is often necessary for a member of the inner partyto know that this or that item of war news is untruthful and he may oftenbe aware that the entire war is spurious and is either not happening oris being waged for purposes quite other than the declared ones but suchknowledge is easily neutralized by the technique of doublethink meanwhileno inner party member wavers for an instant in his mystical belief thatthe war is real and that it is bound to end victoriously with oceaniathe undisputed master of the entire worldall members of the inner party believe in this coming conquest as anarticle of faith it is to be achieved either by gradually acquiring moreand more territory and so building up an overwhelming preponderance ofpower or by the discovery of some new and unanswerable weapon the searchfor new weapons continues unceasingly and is one of the very few remainingactivities in which the inventive or speculative type of mind can find anyoutlet in oceania at the present day science in the old sense hasalmost ceased to exist in newspeak there is no word for science theempirical method of thought on which all the scientific achievements ofthe past were founded is opposed to the most fundamental principles ofingsoc and even technological progress only happens when its products canin some way be used for the diminution of human liberty in all the usefularts the world is either standing still or going backwards the fields arecultivated with horseploughs while books are written by machinery butin matters of vital importancemeaning in effect war and policeespionagethe empirical approach is still encouraged or at leasttolerated the two aims of the party are to conquer the whole surface ofthe earth and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of independentthought there are therefore two great problems which the party isconcerned to solve one is how to discover against his will what anotherhuman being is thinking and the other is how to kill several hundredmillion people in a few seconds without giving warning beforehand inso far as scientific research still continues this is its subject matterthe scientist of today is either a mixture of psychologist and inquisitorstudying with real ordinary minuteness the meaning of facial expressionsgestures and tones of voice and testing the truthproducing effects ofdrugs shock therapy hypnosis and physical torture or he is chemistphysicist or biologist concerned only with such branches of his specialsubject as are relevant to the taking of life in the vast laboratoriesof the ministry of peace and in the experimental stations hidden in thebrazilian forests or in the australian desert or on lost islands ofthe antarctic the teams of experts are indefatigably at work some areconcerned simply with planning the logistics of future wars others deviselarger and larger rocket bombs more and more powerful explosives and moreand more impenetrable armourplating others search for new and deadliergases or for soluble poisons capable of being produced in such quantitiesas to destroy the vegetation of whole continents or for breeds of diseasegerms immunized against all possible antibodies others strive to producea vehicle that shall bore its way under the soil like a submarine underthe water or an aeroplane as independent of its base as a sailingshipothers explore even remoter possibilities such as focusing the suns raysthrough lenses suspended thousands of kilometres away in space orproducing artificial earthquakes and tidal waves by tapping the heat atthe earths centrebut none of these projects ever comes anywhere near realization and noneof the three superstates ever gains a significant lead on the otherswhat is more remarkable is that all three powers already possess in theatomic bomb a weapon far more powerful than any that their presentresearches are likely to discover although the party according to itshabit claims the invention for itself atomic bombs first appeared asearly as the nineteenforties and were first used on a large scale aboutten years later at that time some hundreds of bombs were dropped onindustrial centres chiefly in european russia western europe andnorth america the effect was to convince the ruling groups of allcountries that a few more atomic bombs would mean the end of organizedsociety and hence of their own power thereafter although no formalagreement was ever made or hinted at no more bombs were dropped all threepowers merely continue to produce atomic bombs and store them up againstthe decisive opportunity which they all believe will come sooner or laterand meanwhile the art of war has remained almost stationary for thirty orforty years helicopters are more used than they were formerly bombingplanes have been largely superseded by selfpropelled projectiles and thefragile movable battleship has given way to the almost unsinkable floatingfortress but otherwise there has been little development the tank thesubmarine the torpedo the machine gun even the rifle and the handgrenade are still in use and in spite of the endless slaughters reportedin the press and on the telescreens the desperate battles of earlier warsin which hundreds of thousands or even millions of men were often killedin a few weeks have never been repeatednone of the three superstates ever attempts any manoeuvre which involvesthe risk of serious defeat when any large operation is undertaken it isusually a surprise attack against an ally the strategy that all threepowers are following or pretend to themselves that they are followingis the same the plan is by a combination of fighting bargaining andwelltimed strokes of treachery to acquire a ring of bases completelyencircling one or other of the rival states and then to sign a pact offriendship with that rival and remain on peaceful terms for so many yearsas to lull suspicion to sleep during this time rockets loaded with atomicbombs can be assembled at all the strategic spots finally they will allbe fired simultaneously with effects so devastating as to make retaliationimpossible it will then be time to sign a pact of friendship with theremaining worldpower in preparation for another attack this scheme itis hardly necessary to say is a mere daydream impossible of realizationmoreover no fighting ever occurs except in the disputed areas round theequator and the pole no invasion of enemy territory is ever undertakenthis explains the fact that in some places the frontiers between thesuperstates are arbitrary eurasia for example could easily conquer thebritish isles which are geographically part of europe or on the otherhand it would be possible for oceania to push its frontiers to the rhineor even to the vistula but this would violate the principle followed onall sides though never formulated of cultural integrity if oceania wereto conquer the areas that used once to be known as france and germany itwould be necessary either to exterminate the inhabitants a task of greatphysical difficulty or to assimilate a population of about a hundredmillion people who so far as technical development goes are roughly onthe oceanic level the problem is the same for all three superstatesit is absolutely necessary to their structure that there should be nocontact with foreigners except to a limited extent with war prisonersand coloured slaves even the official ally of the moment is alwaysregarded with the darkest suspicion war prisoners apart the averagecitizen of oceania never sets eyes on a citizen of either eurasia oreastasia and he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages if hewere allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they arecreatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told aboutthem is lies the sealed world in which he lives would be broken and thefear hatred and selfrighteousness on which his morale depends mightevaporate it is therefore realized on all sides that however often persiaor egypt or java or ceylon may change hands the main frontiers mustnever be crossed by anything except bombsunder this lies a fact never mentioned aloud but tacitly understood andacted upon namely that the conditions of life in all three superstatesare very much the same in oceania the prevailing philosophy is calledingsoc in eurasia it is called neobolshevism and in eastasia it iscalled by a chinese name usually translated as deathworship but perhapsbetter rendered as obliteration of the self the citizen of oceania is notallowed to know anything of the tenets of the other two philosophies buthe is taught to execrate them as barbarous outrages upon morality andcommon sense actually the three philosophies are barely distinguishableand the social systems which they support are not distinguishable at alleverywhere there is the same pyramidal structure the same worship ofsemidivine leader the same economy existing by and for continuouswarfare it follows that the three superstates not only cannot conquerone another but would gain no advantage by doing so on the contraryso long as they remain in conflict they prop one another up like threesheaves of corn and as usual the ruling groups of all three powers aresimultaneously aware and unaware of what they are doing their lives arededicated to world conquest but they also know that it is necessary thatthe war should continue everlastingly and without victory meanwhile thefact that there is no danger of conquest makes possible the denial ofreality which is the special feature of ingsoc and its rival systems ofthought here it is necessary to repeat what has been said earlier thatby becoming continuous war has fundamentally changed its characterin past ages a war almost by definition was something that sooner orlater came to an end usually in unmistakable victory or defeat in thepast also war was one of the main instruments by which human societieswere kept in touch with physical reality all rulers in all ages have triedto impose a false view of the world upon their followers but they couldnot afford to encourage any illusion that tended to impair militaryefficiency so long as defeat meant the loss of independence or some otherresult generally held to be undesirable the precautions against defeathad to be serious physical facts could not be ignored in philosophy orreligion or ethics or politics two and two might make five but whenone was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make four inefficientnations were always conquered sooner or later and the struggle forefficiency was inimical to illusions moreover to be efficient it wasnecessary to be able to learn from the past which meant having a fairlyaccurate idea of what had happened in the past newspapers and historybooks were of course always coloured and biased but falsification ofthe kind that is practised today would have been impossible war was asure safeguard of sanity and so far as the ruling classes were concernedit was probably the most important of all safeguards while wars could bewon or lost no ruling class could be completely irresponsiblebut when war becomes literally continuous it also ceases to be dangerouswhen war is continuous there is no such thing as military necessitytechnical progress can cease and the most palpable facts can be denied ordisregarded as we have seen researches that could be called scientificare still carried out for the purposes of war but they are essentially akind of daydreaming and their failure to show results is not importantefficiency even military efficiency is no longer needed nothing isefficient in oceania except the thought police since each of the threesuperstates is unconquerable each is in effect a separate universe withinwhich almost any perversion of thought can be safely practised realityonly exerts its pressure through the needs of everyday lifethe need toeat and drink to get shelter and clothing to avoid swallowing poison orstepping out of topstorey windows and the like between life and deathand between physical pleasure and physical pain there is still adistinction but that is all cut off from contact with the outer worldand with the past the citizen of oceania is like a man in interstellarspace who has no way of knowing which direction is up and which is downthe rulers of such a state are absolute as the pharaohs or the caesarscould not be they are obliged to prevent their followers from starvingto death in numbers large enough to be inconvenient and they are obligedto remain at the same low level of military technique as their rivals butonce that minimum is achieved they can twist reality into whatever shapethey choosethe war therefore if we judge it by the standards of previous wars ismerely an imposture it is like the battles between certain ruminantanimals whose horns are set at such an angle that they are incapable ofhurting one another but though it is unreal it is not meaningless iteats up the surplus of consumable goods and it helps to preserve thespecial mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society needs war it willbe seen is now a purely internal affair in the past the ruling groupsof all countries although they might recognize their common interest andtherefore limit the destructiveness of war did fight against one anotherand the victor always plundered the vanquished in our own day they arenot fighting against one another at all the war is waged by each rulinggroup against its own subjects and the object of the war is not to makeor prevent conquests of territory but to keep the structure of societyintact the very word war therefore has become misleading it wouldprobably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased toexist the peculiar pressure that it exerted on human beings between theneolithic age and the early twentieth century has disappeared and beenreplaced by something quite different the effect would be much the sameif the three superstates instead of fighting one another should agreeto live in perpetual peace each inviolate within its own boundaries forin that case each would still be a selfcontained universe freed for everfrom the sobering influence of external danger a peace that was trulypermanent would be the same as a permanent war thisalthough the vastmajority of party members understand it only in a shallower senseis theinner meaning of the party slogan war is peacewinston stopped reading for a moment somewhere in remote

anotherive got the book he said as they disentangled themselvesoh youve got it good she said without much interest and almostimmediately knelt down beside the oil stove to make the coffeethey did not return to the subject until they had been in bed for half anhour the evening was just cool enough to make it worth while to pull upthe counterpane from below came the familiar sound of singing and

book against his knees and began readingchapter iignorance is strengththroughout recorded time and probably since the end of the neolithic agethere have been three kinds of people in the world the high the middleand the low they have been subdivided in many ways they have bornecountless different names and their relative numbers as well as theirattitude towards one another have varied from age to age but theessential structure of society has never altered even after enormousupheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes the same pattern has alwaysreasserted itself just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibriumhowever far it is pushed one way or the otherjulia are you awake said winstonyes my love im listening go on its marvelloushe continued readingthe aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable the aim ofthe high is to remain where they are the aim of the middle is to changeplaces with the high the aim of the low when they have an aimfor itis an abiding characteristic of the low that they are too much crushedby drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outsidetheir daily livesis to abolish all distinctions and create a society inwhich all men shall be equal thus throughout history a struggle which isthe same in its main outlines recurs over and over again for long periodsthe high seem to be securely in power but sooner or later there alwayscomes a moment when they lose either their belief in themselves or theircapacity to govern efficiently or both they are then overthrown by themiddle who enlist the low on their side by pretending to them that theyare fighting for liberty and justice as soon as they have reached theirobjective the middle thrust the low back into their old position ofservitude and themselves become the high presently a new middle groupsplits off from one of the other groups or from both of them and thestruggle begins over again of the three groups only the low are nevereven temporarily successful in achieving their aims it would be anexaggeration to say that throughout history there has been no progress ofa material kind even today in a period of decline the average humanbeing is physically better off than he was a few centuries ago but noadvance in wealth no softening of manners no reform or revolution hasever brought human equality a millimetre nearer from the point of view ofthe low no historic change has ever meant much more than a change in thename of their mastersby the late nineteenth century the recurrence of this pattern had becomeobvious to many observers there then rose schools of thinkers whointerpreted history as a cyclical process and claimed to show thatinequality was the unalterable law of human life this doctrine of coursehad always had its adherents but in the manner in which it was now putforward there was a significant change in the past the need for ahierarchical form of society had been the doctrine specifically of thehigh it had been preached by kings and aristocrats and by the priestslawyers and the like who were parasitical upon them and it had generallybeen softened by promises of compensation in an imaginary world beyond thegrave the middle so long as it was struggling for power had always madeuse of such terms as freedom justice and fraternity now however theconcept of human brotherhood began to be assailed by people who were notyet in positions of command but merely hoped to be so before long in thepast the middle had made revolutions under the banner of equality andthen had established a fresh tyranny as soon as the old one was overthrownthe new middle groups in effect proclaimed their tyranny beforehandsocialism a theory which appeared in the early nineteenth century and wasthe last link in a chain of thought stretching back to the slave rebellionsof antiquity was still deeply infected by the utopianism of past agesbut in each variant of socialism that appeared from about  onwards theaim of establishing liberty and equality was more and more openlyabandoned the new movements which appeared in the middle years of thecentury ingsoc in oceania neobolshevism in eurasia deathworship asit is commonly called in eastasia had the conscious aim of perpetuatingunfreedom and inequality these new movements of course grew out of theold ones and tended to keep their names and pay lipservice to theirideology but the purpose of all of them was to arrest progress and freezehistory at a chosen moment the familiar pendulum swing was to happen oncemore and then stop as usual the high were to be turned out by themiddle who would then become the high but this time by consciousstrategy the high would be able to maintain their position permanentlythe new doctrines arose partly because of the accumulation of historicalknowledge and the growth of the historical sense which had hardly existedbefore the nineteenth century the cyclical movement of history was nowintelligible or appeared to be so and if it was intelligible then itwas alterable but the principal underlying cause was that as earlyas the beginning of the twentieth century human equality had becometechnically possible it was still true that men were not equal in theirnative talents and that functions had to be specialized in ways thatfavoured some individuals against others but there was no longer any realneed for class distinctions or for large differences of wealth in earlierages class distinctions had been not only inevitable but desirableinequality was the price of civilization with the development of machineproduction however the case was altered even if it was still necessaryfor human beings to do different kinds of work it was no longer necessaryfor them to live at different social or economic levels therefore fromthe point of view of the new groups who were on the point of seizing powerhuman equality was no longer an ideal to be striven after but a danger tobe averted in more primitive ages when a just and peaceful society wasin fact not possible it had been fairly easy to believe it the idea ofan earthly paradise in which men should live together in a state ofbrotherhood without laws and without brute labour had haunted the humanimagination for thousands of years and this vision had had a certain holdeven on the groups who actually profited by each historical change theheirs of the french english and american revolutions had partly believedin their own phrases about the rights of man freedom of speech equalitybefore the law and the like and have even allowed their conduct to beinfluenced by them to some extent but by the fourth decade of thetwentieth century all the main currents of political thought wereauthoritarian the earthly paradise had been discredited at exactly themoment when it became realizable every new political theory by whatevername it called itself led back to hierarchy and regimentation and in thegeneral hardening of outlook that set in round about  practices whichhad been long abandoned in some cases for hundreds of yearsimprisonmentwithout trial the use of war prisoners as slaves public executionstorture to extract confessions the use of hostages and the deportationof whole populationsnot only became common again but were toleratedand even defended by people who considered themselves enlightened andprogressiveit was only after a decade of national wars civil wars revolutions andcounterrevolutions in all parts of the world that ingsoc and its rivalsemerged as fully workedout political theories but they had beenforeshadowed by the various systems generally called totalitarian whichhad appeared earlier in the century and the main outlines of the worldwhich would emerge from the prevailing chaos had long been obvious whatkind of people would control this world had been equally obvious the newaristocracy was made up for the most part of bureaucrats scientiststechnicians tradeunion organizers publicity experts sociologiststeachers journalists and professional politicians these people whoseorigins lay in the salaried middle class and the upper grades of theworking class had been shaped and brought together by the barren world ofmonopoly industry and centralized government as compared with theiropposite numbers in past ages they were less avaricious less tempted byluxury hungrier for pure power and above all more conscious of whatthey were doing and more intent on crushing opposition this lastdifference was cardinal by comparison with that existing today all thetyrannies of the past were halfhearted and inefficient the ruling groupswere always infected to some extent by liberal ideas and were content toleave loose ends everywhere to regard only the overt act and to beuninterested in what their subjects were thinking even the catholic churchof the middle ages was tolerant by modern standards part of the reasonfor this was that in the past no government had the power to keep itscitizens under constant surveillance the invention of print howevermade it easier to manipulate public opinion and the film and the radiocarried the process further with the development of television andthe technical advance which made it possible to receive and transmitsimultaneously on the same instrument private life came to an end everycitizen or at least every citizen important enough to be worth watchingcould be kept for twentyfour hours a day under the eyes of the policeand in the sound of official propaganda with all other channels ofcommunication closed the possibility of enforcing not only completeobedience to the will of the state but complete uniformity of opinionon all subjects now existed for the first timeafter the revolutionary period of the fifties and sixties societyregrouped itself as always into high middle and low but the new highgroup unlike all its forerunners did not act upon instinct but knew whatwas needed to safeguard its position it had long been realized that theonly secure basis for oligarchy is collectivism wealth and privilegeare most easily defended when they are possessed jointly the socalledabolition of private property which took place in the middle years ofthe century meant in effect the concentration of property in far fewerhands than before but with this difference that the new owners were agroup instead of a mass of individuals individually no member of theparty owns anything except petty personal belongings collectively theparty owns everything in oceania because it controls everything anddisposes of the products as it thinks fit in the years following therevolution it was able to step into this commanding position almostunopposed because the whole process was represented as an act ofcollectivization it had always been assumed that if the capitalist classwere expropriated socialism must follow and unquestionably thecapitalists had been expropriated factories mines land housestransporteverything had been taken away from them and since thesethings were no longer private property it followed that they must bepublic property ingsoc which grew out of the earlier socialist movementand inherited its phraseology has in fact carried out the main item inthe socialist programme with the result foreseen and intended beforehandthat economic inequality has been made permanentbut the problems of perpetuating a hierarchical society go deeper thanthis there are only four ways in which a ruling group can fall from powereither it is conquered from without or it governs so inefficiently thatthe masses are stirred to revolt or it allows a strong and discontentedmiddle group to come into being or it loses its own selfconfidence andwillingness to govern these causes do not operate singly and as a ruleall four of them are present in some degree a ruling class which couldguard against all of them would remain in power permanently ultimatelythe determining factor is the mental attitude of the ruling class itselfafter the middle of the present century the first danger had in realitydisappeared each of the three powers which now divide the world is infact unconquerable and could only become conquerable through slowdemographic changes which a government with wide powers can easily avertthe second danger also is only a theoretical one the masses neverrevolt of their own accord and they never revolt merely because they areoppressed indeed so long as they are not permitted to have standards ofcomparison they never even become aware that they are oppressed therecurrent economic crises of past times were totally unnecessary and arenot now permitted to happen but other and equally large dislocationscan and do happen without having political results because there is noway in which discontent can become articulate as for the problem ofoverproduction which has been latent in our society since the developmentof machine technique it is solved by the device of continuous warfaresee chapter iii which is also useful in keying up public morale to thenecessary pitch from the point of view of our present rulers thereforethe only genuine dangers are the splittingoff of a new group of ableunderemployed powerhungry people and the growth of liberalism andscepticism in their own ranks the problem that is to say is educationalit is a problem of continuously moulding the consciousness both of thedirecting group and of the larger executive group that lies immediatelybelow it the consciousness of the masses needs only to be influenced ina negative waygiven this background one could

big brother comes the inner party its numbers limited to sixmillions or something less than  per cent of the population of oceaniabelow the inner party comes the outer party which if the inner party isdescribed as the brain of the state may be justly likened to the handsbelow that come the dumb masses whom we habitually refer to as theproles numbering perhaps  per cent of the population in the termsof our earlier classification the proles are the low for the slavepopulation of the equatorial lands who pass constantly from conquerorto conqueror are not a permanent or necessary part of the structurein principle membership of these three groups is not hereditary thechild of inner party parents is in theory not born into the inner partyadmission to either branch of the party is by examination taken at theage of sixteen nor is there any racial discrimination or any markeddomination of one province by another jews negroes south americans ofpure indian blood are to be found in the highest ranks of the party andthe administrators of any area are always drawn from the inhabitants ofthat area in no part of oceania do the inhabitants have the feeling thatthey are a colonial population ruled from a distant capital oceania hasno capital and its titular head is a person whose whereabouts nobodyknows except that english is its chief lingua franca and newspeak itsofficial language it is not centralized in any way its rulers are notheld together by bloodties but by adherence to a common doctrine it istrue that our society is stratified and very rigidly stratified on whatat first sight appear to be hereditary lines there is far less toandfromovement between the different groups than happened under capitalism oreven in the preindustrial age between the two branches of the partythere is a certain amount of interchange but only so much as will ensurethat weaklings are excluded from the inner party and that ambitiousmembers of the outer party are made harmless by allowing them to riseproletarians in practice are not allowed to graduate into the party themost gifted among them who might possibly become nuclei of discontentare simply marked down by the thought police and eliminated but thisstate of affairs is not necessarily permanent nor is it a matter ofprinciple the party is not a class in the old sense of the word it doesnot aim at transmitting power to its own children as such and if therewere no other way of keeping the ablest people at the top it would beperfectly prepared to recruit an entire new generation from the ranks ofthe proletariat in the crucial years the fact that the party was not ahereditary body did a great deal to neutralize opposition the older kindof socialist who had been trained to fight against something calledclass privilege assumed that what is not hereditary cannot be permanenthe did not see that the continuity of an oligarchy need not be physicalnor did he pause to reflect that hereditary aristocracies have always beenshortlived whereas adoptive organizations such as the catholic churchhave sometimes lasted for hundreds or thousands of years the essence ofoligarchical rule is not fathertoson inheritance but the persistence ofa certain worldview and a certain way of life imposed by the dead uponthe living a ruling group is a ruling group so long as it can nominateits successors the party is not concerned with perpetuating its blood butwith perpetuating itself who wields power is not important provided thatthe hierarchical structure remains always the sameall the beliefs habits tastes emotions mental attitudes thatcharacterize our time are really designed to sustain the mystique ofthe party and prevent the true nature of presentday society from beingperceived physical rebellion or any preliminary move towards rebellionis at present not possible from the proletarians nothing is to be fearedleft to themselves they will continue from generation to generation andfrom century to century working breeding and dying not only withoutany impulse to rebel but without the power of grasping that the worldcould be other than it is they could only become dangerous if the advanceof industrial technique made it necessary to educate them more highlybut since military and commercial rivalry are no longer important thelevel of popular education is actually declining what opinions the masseshold or do not hold is looked on as a matter of indifference they canbe granted intellectual liberty because they have no intellect in a partymember on the other hand not even the smallest deviation of opinion onthe most unimportant subject can be tolerateda party member lives from birth to death under the eye of the thoughtpolice even when he is alone he can never be sure that he is

actually been committed but are merely thewipingout of persons who might perhaps commit a crime at some time in thefuture a party member is required to have not only the right opinionsbut the right instincts many of the beliefs and attitudes demanded of himare never plainly stated and could not be stated without laying bare thecontradictions inherent in ingsoc if he is a person naturally orthodoxin newspeak a goodthinker he will in all circumstances know withouttaking thought what is the true belief or the desirable emotion but inany case an elaborate mental training undergone in childhood and groupingitself round the newspeak words crimestop blackwhite and doublethinkmakes him unwilling and unable to think too deeply on any subject whatevera party member is expected to have

leading in a heretical direction crimestopin short means protective stupidity but stupidity is not enough on thecontrary orthodoxy in the full sense demands a control over ones ownmental processes as complete as that of a contortionist over his bodyoceanic society rests ultimately on the belief that big brother isomnipotent and that the party is infallible but since in reality bigbrother is not omnipotent and the party is not infallible there is needfor an unwearying momenttomoment flexibility in the treatment of factsthe keyword here is blackwhite like so many newspeak words this word hastwo mutually contradictory meanings applied to an opponent it means thehabit of impudently claiming that black is white in contradiction of theplain facts applied to a party member it means a loyal willingness tosay that black is white when party discipline demands this but it meansalso the ability to believe that black is white and more to know thatblack is white and to forget that one has ever believed the contrarythis demands a continuous alteration of the past made possible by thesystem of thought which really embraces all the rest and which is knownin newspeak as doublethinkthe alteration of the past is necessary for two reasons one of which issubsidiary and so to speak precautionary the subsidiary reason is thatthe party member like the proletarian tolerates presentday conditionspartly because he has no standards of comparison he must be cut off fromthe past just as he must be cut off from foreign countries because it isnecessary for him to believe that he is better off than his ancestors andthat the average level of material comfort is constantly rising but byfar the more important reason for the readjustment of the past is theneed to safeguard the infallibility of the party it is not merely thatspeeches statistics and records of every kind must be constantly broughtup to date in order to show that the predictions of the party were inall cases right it is also that no change in doctrine or in politicalalignment can ever be admitted for to change ones mind or even onespolicy is a confession of weakness if for example eurasia or eastasiawhichever it may be is the enemy today then that country must alwayshave been the enemy and if the facts say otherwise then the facts mustbe altered thus history is continuously rewritten this daytodayfalsification of the past carried out by the ministry of truth is asnecessary to the stability of the regime as the work of repression andespionage carried out by the ministry of lovethe mutability of the past is the central tenet of ingsoc past eventsit is argued have no objective existence but survive only in writtenrecords and in human memories the past is whatever the records and thememories agree upon and since the party is in full control of all recordsand in equally full control of the minds of its members it follows thatthe past is whatever the party chooses to make it it also follows thatthough the past is alterable it never has been altered in any specificinstance for when it has been recreated in whatever shape is needed atthe moment then this new version is the past and no different past canever have existed this holds good even when as often happens the sameevent has to be altered out of recognition several times in the course ofa year at all times the party is in possession of absolute truth andclearly the absolute can never have been different from what it is nowit will be seen that the control of the past depends above all on thetraining of memory to make sure that all written records agree withthe orthodoxy of the moment is merely a mechanical act but it is alsonecessary to remember that events happened in the desired manner and ifit is necessary to rearrange ones memories or to tamper with writtenrecords then it is necessary to forget that one has done so the trick ofdoing this can be learned like any other mental technique it is learnedby the majority of party members and certainly by all who are intelligentas well as orthodox in oldspeak it is called quite frankly realitycontrol in newspeak it is called doublethink though doublethinkcomprises much else as welldoublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in onesmind simultaneously and accepting both of them the party intellectualknows in which direction his memories must be altered he therefore knowsthat he is playing tricks with reality but by the exercise of doublethinkhe also satisfies himself that reality is not violated the process has tobe conscious or it would not be carried out with sufficient precisionbut it also has to be unconscious or it would bring with it a feeling offalsity and hence of guilt doublethink lies at the very heart of ingsocsince the essential act of the party is to use conscious deception whileretaining the firmness of purpose that goes with complete honesty to telldeliberate lies while genuinely believing in them to forget any fact thathas become inconvenient and then when it becomes necessary again todraw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed to deny theexistence of objective reality and all the while to take account of thereality which one deniesall this is indispensably necessary even inusing the word doublethink it is necessary to exercise doublethink forby using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality by afresh act of doublethink one erases this knowledge and so on indefinitelywith the lie always one leap ahead of the truth ultimately it is by meansof doublethink that the party has been ableand may for all we knowcontinue to be able for thousands of yearsto arrest the course ofhistoryall past oligarchies have fallen from power either because they ossifiedor because they grew soft either they became stupid and arrogant failedto adjust themselves to changing circumstances and were overthrown orthey became liberal and cowardly made concessions when they should haveused force and once again were overthrown they fell that is to sayeither through consciousness or through unconsciousness it is theachievement of the party to have produced a system of thought in whichboth conditions can exist simultaneously and upon no other intellectualbasis could the dominion of the party be made permanent if one is to ruleand to continue ruling one must be able to dislocate the sense of realityfor the secret of rulership is to combine a belief in ones owninfallibility with the power to learn from past mistakesit need hardly be said that the subtlest practitioners of doublethink arethose who invented doublethink and know that it is a vast system of mentalcheating in our society those who have the best knowledge of what ishappening are also those who are furthest from seeing the world as it isin general the greater the understanding the greater the delusion themore intelligent the less sane one clear illustration of this is thefact that war hysteria increases in intensity as one rises in the socialscale those whose attitude towards the war is most nearly rational arethe subject peoples of the disputed territories to these people the waris simply a continuous calamity which sweeps to and fro over their bodieslike a tidal wave which side is winning is a matter of completeindifference to them they are aware that a change of overlordship meanssimply that they will be doing the same work as before for new masters whotreat them in the same manner as the old ones the slightly more favouredworkers whom we call the proles are only intermittently conscious of thewar when it is necessary they can be prodded into frenzies of fear andhatred but when left to themselves they are capable of forgetting forlong periods that the war is happening it is in the ranks of the partyand above all of the inner party that the true war enthusiasm is foundworldconquest is believed in most firmly by those who know it to beimpossible this peculiar linkingtogether of oppositesknowledge withignorance cynicism with fanaticismis one of the chief distinguishingmarks of oceanic society the official ideology abounds with contradictionseven when there is no practical reason for them thus the party rejectsand vilifies every principle for which the socialist movement originallystood and it chooses to do this in the name of socialism it preachesa contempt for the working class unexampled for centuries past and itdresses its members in a uniform which was at one time peculiar to manualworkers and was adopted for that reason it systematically undermines thesolidarity of the family and it calls its leader by a name which is adirect appeal to the sentiment of family loyalty even the names of thefour ministries by which we are governed exhibit a sort of impudence intheir deliberate reversal of the facts the ministry of peace concernsitself with war the ministry of truth with lies the ministry of lovewith torture and the ministry of plenty with starvation thesecontradictions are not accidental nor do they result from ordinaryhypocrisy they are deliberate exercises in doublethink for it is onlyby reconciling contradictions that power can be retained indefinitelyin no other way could the ancient cycle be broken if human equality isto be for ever avertedif the high as we have called them are to keeptheir places permanentlythen the prevailing mental condition must becontrolled insanitybut there is one question which until this moment we have almost ignoredit is why should human equality be averted supposing that the mechanicsof the process have been rightly described what is the motive for thishuge accurately planned effort to freeze history at a particular momentof timehere we reach the central secret as we have seen the mystique of theparty and above all of the inner party depends upon doublethink butdeeper than this lies the original motive the neverquestioned instinctthat first led to the seizure of power and brought doublethink thethought police continuous warfare and all the other necessaryparaphernalia into existence afterwards this motive really consistswinston became aware of silence as one becomes aware of a new sound itseemed to him that julia had been very still for some time past she waslying on her side naked from the waist upwards with her cheek pillowedon her hand and one dark lock tumbling across her eyes her breast roseand fell slowly and regularlyjuliano answerjulia are you awakeno answer she was asleep he shut the book put it carefully on the floorlay down and pulled the coverlet over both of themhe had still he reflected not learned the ultimate secret he understoodhow he did not understand why chapter i like chapter iii had notactually told him anything that he did not know it had merely systematizedthe knowledge that he possessed already but after reading it he knewbetter than before that he was not mad being in a minority even aminority of one did not make you mad there was truth and there wasuntruth and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world youwere not mad a yellow beam from the sinking sun slanted in through thewindow and fell across the pillow he shut his eyes the sun on his faceand the girls smooth body touching his own gave him a strong sleepyconfident feeling he was safe everything was all right he fell asleepmurmuring sanity is not statistical with the feeling that this remarkcontained in it a profound wisdomwhen he woke it was with the sensation of having slept for a long timebut a glance at the oldfashioned clock told him that it was onlytwentythirty he lay dozing for a while then the usual deeplungedsinging struck up from the yard below  it was only an opeless fancy  it passed like an ipril dye  but a look an a word an the dreams they stirred  they ave stolen my eart awyethe drivelling song seemed to have kept its popularity you still heard itall over the place it had outlived the hate song julia woke at thesound stretched herself luxuriously and got out of bedim hungry she said lets make some more coffee damn the stovesgone out and the waters cold she picked the stove up and shook ittheres no oil in itwe can get some from old charrington i expectthe funny thing is i made sure it was full im going to put my clotheson she added it seems to have got colderwinston also got up and dressed himself the indefatigable voice sang on  they sye that time eals all things  they sye you can always forget  but the smiles an the tears acrorss the years  they twist my eartstrings yetas he fastened the belt of his overalls he strolled across to the windowthe sun must have gone down behind the houses it was not shining into theyard any longer the flagstones were wet as though they had just beenwashed and he had the feeling that the sky had been washed too so freshand pale was the blue between the chimneypots tirelessly the womanmarched to and fro corking and uncorking herself singing and fallingsilent and pegging out more diapers and more and yet more he wonderedwhether she took in washing for a living or was merely the slave of twentyor thirty grandchildren julia had come across to his side together theygazed down with a sort of fascination at the sturdy figure below as helooked at the woman in her characteristic attitude her thick arms reachingup for the line her powerful marelike buttocks protruded it struck himfor the first time that she was beautiful it had never before occurred tohim that the body of a woman of fifty blown up to monstrous dimensions bychildbearing then hardened roughened by work till it was coarse in thegrain like an overripe turnip could be beautiful but it was so andafter all he thought why not the solid contourless body like a blockof granite and the rasping red skin bore the same relation to the bodyof a girl as the rosehip to the rose why should the fruit be heldinferior to the flowershes beautiful he murmuredshes a metre across the hips easily said juliathat is her style of beauty said winstonhe held julias supple waist easily encircled by his arm from the hip tothe knee her flank was against his out of their bodies no child wouldever come that was the one thing they could never do only by word ofmouth from mind to mind could they pass on the secret the woman downthere had no mind she had only strong arms a warm heart and a fertilebelly he wondered how many children she had given birth to it mighteasily be fifteen she had had her momentary flowering a year perhapsof wildrose beauty and then she had suddenly swollen like a fertilizedfruit and grown hard and red and coarse and then her life had beenlaundering scrubbing darning cooking sweeping polishing mendingscrubbing laundering first for children then for grandchildren overthirty unbroken years at the end of it she was still singing the mysticalreverence that he felt for her was somehow mixed up with the aspect ofthe pale cloudless sky stretching away behind the chimneypots intointerminable distance it was curious to think that the sky was the samefor everybody in eurasia or eastasia as well as here and the peopleunder the sky were also very much the sameeverywhere all over the worldhundreds of thousands of millions of people just like this people ignorantof one anothers existence held apart by walls of hatred and lies andyet almost exactly the samepeople who had never learned to think but whowere storing up in their hearts and bellies and muscles the power thatwould one day overturn the world if there was hope it lay in the proleswithout having read to the end of the book he knew that that must begoldsteins final message the future belonged to the proles and could hebe sure that when their time came the world they constructed would not bejust as alien to him winston smith as the world of the party yesbecause at the least it would be a world of sanity where there isequality there can be sanity sooner or later it would happen strengthwould change into consciousness the proles were immortal you could notdoubt it when you looked at that valiant figure in the yard in the endtheir awakening would come and until that happened though it might be athousand years they would stay alive against all the odds like birdspassing on from body to body the vitality which the party did not shareand could not killdo you remember he said the thrush that sang to us that first dayat the edge of the woodhe wasnt singing to us said julia he was singing to please himselfnot even that he was just singingthe birds sang the proles sang the party did not sing all round theworld in london and new york in africa and brazil and in the mysteriousforbidden lands beyond the frontiers in the streets of paris and berlinin the villages of the endless russian plain in the bazaars of china andjapaneverywhere stood the same solid unconquerable figure made monstrousby work and childbearing toiling from birth to death and still singingout of those mighty loins a race of conscious beings must one day comeyou were the dead theirs was the future but you could share in thatfuture if you kept alive the mind as they kept alive the body and passedon the secret doctrine that two plus two make fourwe are the dead he saidwe are the dead echoed julia dutifullyyou are the dead said an iron voice behind themthey sprang apart winstons entrails seemed to have turned into ice hecould see the white all round the irises of julias eyes her face hadturned a milky yellow the smear of rouge that was still on each cheekbonestood out sharply almost as though unconnected with the skin beneathyou are the dead repeated the iron voiceit was behind the picture breathed juliait was behind the picture said the voice remain exactly where youare make no movement until you are orderedit was starting it was starting at last they could do nothing exceptstand gazing into one anothers eyes to run for life to get out of thehouse before it was too lateno such thought occurred to them unthinkableto disobey the iron voice from the wall there was a snap as though a catchhad been turned back and a crash of breaking glass the picture had fallento the floor uncovering the telescreen behind itnow they can see us said julianow we can see you said the voice stand out in the middle of theroom stand back to back clasp your hands behind your heads do not touchone anotherthey were not touching but it seemed to him that he could feel juliasbody shaking or perhaps it was merely the shaking of his own he couldjust stop his teeth from chattering but his knees were beyond his controlthere was a sound of trampling boots below inside the house and outsidethe yard seemed to be full of men something was being dragged across thestones the womans singing had stopped abruptly there was a long rollingclang as though the washtub had been flung across the yard and then aconfusion of angry shouts which ended in a yell of painthe house is surrounded said winstonthe house is surrounded said the voicehe heard julia snap her teeth together i suppose we may as well saygoodbye she saidyou may as well say goodbye said the voice and then another quitedifferent voice a thin cultivated voice which winston had the impressionof having heard before struck in and by the way while we are on thesubject here comes a candle to light you to bed here comes a chopper tochop off your headsomething crashed on to the bed behind winstons back the head of a ladderhad been thrust through the window and had burst in the frame someone wasclimbing through the window there was a stampede of boots up the stairsthe room was full of solid men in black uniforms with ironshod boots ontheir feet and truncheons in their handswinston was not trembling any longer even his eyes he barely moved onething alone mattered to keep still to keep still and not give them anexcuse to hit you a man with a smooth prizefighters jowl in which themouth was only a slit paused opposite him balancing his truncheonmeditatively between thumb and forefinger winston met his eyes thefeeling of nakedness with ones hands behind ones head and ones faceand body all exposed was almost unbearable the man protruded the tipof a white tongue licked the place where his lips should have been andthen passed on there was another crash someone had picked up the glasspaperweight from the table and smashed it to pieces on the hearthstonethe fragment of coral a tiny crinkle of pink like a sugar rosebud froma cake rolled across the mat how small thought winston how small italways was there was a gasp and a thump behind him and he received aviolent kick on the ankle which nearly flung him off his balance one ofthe men had smashed his fist into julias solar plexus doubling her uplike a pocket ruler she was thrashing about on the floor fighting forbreath winston dared not turn his head even by a millimetre but sometimesher livid gasping face came within the angle of his vision even in histerror it was as though he could feel the pain in his own body the deadlypain which nevertheless was less urgent than the struggle to get back herbreath he knew what it was like the terrible agonizing pain which wasthere all the while but could not be suffered yet because before all elseit was necessary to be able to breathe then two of the men hoisted herup by knees and shoulders and carried her out of the room like a sackwinston had a glimpse of her face upside down yellow and contorted withthe eyes shut and still with a smear of rouge on either cheek and thatwas the last he saw of herhe stood dead still no one had hit him yet thoughts which came of theirown accord but seemed totally uninteresting began to flit through hismind he wondered whether they had got mr charrington he wondered whatthey had done to the woman in the yard he noticed that he badly wantedto urinate and felt a faint surprise because he had done so only two orthree hours ago he noticed that the clock on the mantelpiece said ninemeaning twentyone but the light seemed too strong would not the lightbe fading at twentyone hours on an august evening he wondered whetherafter all he and julia had mistaken the timehad slept the clock roundand thought it was twentythirty when really it was nought eightthirtyon the following morning but he did not pursue the thought furtherit was not interestingthere was another lighter step in the passage mr charrington came intothe room the demeanour of the blackuniformed men suddenly became moresubdued something had also changed in mr charringtons appearance hiseye fell on the fragments of the glass paperweightpick up those pieces he said sharplya man stooped to obey the cockney accent had disappeared winston suddenlyrealized whose voice it was that he had heard a few moments ago on thetelescreen mr charrington was still wearing his old velvet jacket buthis hair which had been almost white had turned black also he was notwearing his spectacles he gave winston a single sharp glance as thoughverifying his identity and then paid no more attention to him he wasstill recognizable but he was not the same person any longer his bodyhad straightened and seemed to have grown bigger his face had undergoneonly tiny changes that had nevertheless worked a complete transformationthe black eyebrows were less bushy the wrinkles were gone the wholelines of the face seemed to have altered even the nose seemed shorter itwas the alert cold face of a man of about fiveandthirty it occurred towinston that for the first time in his life he was looking with knowledgeat a member of the thought policepart threechapter he did not know where he was presumably he was in the ministry of lovebut there was no way of making certain he was in a highceilingedwindowless cell with walls of glittering white porcelain concealed lampsflooded it with cold light and there was a low steady humming soundwhich he supposed had something to do with the air supply a bench orshelf just wide enough to sit on ran round the wall broken only by thedoor and at the end opposite the door a lavatory pan with no woodenseat there were four telescreens one in each wallthere was a dull aching in his belly it had been there ever since theyhad bundled him into the closed van and driven him away but he was alsohungry with a gnawing unwholesome kind of hunger it might be twentyfourhours since he had eaten it might be thirtysix he still did not knowprobably never would know whether it had been morning or evening whenthey arrested him since he was arrested he had not been fedhe sat as still as he could on the narrow bench with his hands crossedon his knee he had already learned to sit still if you made unexpectedmovements they yelled at you from the telescreen but the craving for foodwas growing upon him what he longed for above all was a piece of breadhe had an idea that there were a few breadcrumbs in the pocket of hisoveralls it was even possiblehe thought this because from time to timesomething seemed to tickle his legthat there might be a sizeable bit ofcrust there in the end the temptation to find out overcame his fear heslipped a hand into his pocketsmith yelled a voice from the telescreen  smith w hands out ofpockets in the cellshe sat still again his hands crossed on his knee before being broughthere he had been taken to another place which must have been an ordinaryprison or a temporary lockup used by the patrols he did not know howlong he had been there some hours at any rate with no clocks and nodaylight it was hard to gauge the time it was a noisy evilsmellingplace they had put him into a cell similar to the one he was now inbut filthily dirty and at all times crowded by ten or fifteen people themajority of them were common criminals but there were a few politicalprisoners among them he had sat silent against the wall jostled by dirtybodies too preoccupied by fear and the pain in his belly to take muchinterest in his surroundings but still noticing the astonishing differencein demeanour between the party prisoners and the others the partyprisoners were always silent and terrified but the ordinary criminalsseemed to care nothing for anybody they yelled insults at the guardsfought back fiercely when their belongings were impounded wrote obscenewords on the floor ate smuggled food which they produced from mysterioushidingplaces in their clothes and even shouted down the telescreen whenit tried to restore order on the other hand some of them seemed to be ongood terms with the guards called them by nicknames and tried to wheedlecigarettes through the spyhole in the door the guards too treated thecommon criminals with a certain forbearance even when they had to handlethem roughly there was much talk about the forcedlabour camps to whichmost of the prisoners expected to be sent it was all right in thecamps he gathered so long as you had good contacts and knew the ropesthere was bribery favouritism and racketeering of every kind there washomosexuality and prostitution there was even illicit alcohol distilledfrom potatoes the positions of trust were given only to the commoncriminals especially the gangsters and the murderers who formed a sortof aristocracy all the dirty jobs were done by the politicalsthere was a constant comeandgo of prisoners of every descriptiondrugpeddlers thieves bandits blackmarketeers drunks prostitutessome of the drunks were so violent that the other prisoners had to combineto suppress them an enormous wreck of a woman aged about sixty withgreat tumbling breasts and thick coils of white hair which had come downin her struggles was carried in kicking and shouting by four guardswho had hold of her one at each corner they wrenched off the boots withwhich she had been trying to kick them and dumped her down acrosswinstons lap almost breaking his thighbones the woman hoisted herselfupright and followed them out with a yell of f bastards thennoticing that she was sitting on something uneven she slid off winstonsknees on to the benchbeg pardon dearie she said i wouldnt a sat on you only the buggersput me there they dono ow to treat a lady do they she paused pattedher breast and belched pardon she said i aint meself quiteshe leant forward and vomited copiously on the floorthass better she said leaning back with closed eyes never keep itdown thass what i say get it up while its fresh on your stomach likeshe revived turned to have another look at winston and seemed immediatelyto take a fancy to him she put a vast arm round his shoulder and drew himtowards her breathing beer and vomit into his facewass your name dearie she saidsmith said winstonsmith said the woman thass funny my names smith too why sheadded sentimentally i might be your mothershe might thought winston be his mother she was about the right age andphysique and it was probable that people changed somewhat after twentyyears in a forcedlabour campno one else had spoken to him to a surprising extent the ordinarycriminals ignored the party prisoners the polits they called themwith a sort of uninterested contempt the party prisoners seemed terrifiedof speaking to anybody and above all of speaking to one another onlyonce when two party members both women were pressed close together onthe bench he overheard amid the din of voices a few hurriedlywhisperedwords and in particular a reference to something called room oneohonewhich he did not understandit might be two or three hours ago that they had brought him here thedull pain in his belly never went away but sometimes it grew better andsometimes worse and his thoughts expanded or contracted accordingly whenit grew worse he thought only of the pain itself and of his desire forfood when it grew better panic took hold of him there were momentswhen he foresaw the things that would happen to him with such actualitythat his heart galloped and his breath stopped he felt the smash oftruncheons on his elbows and ironshod boots on his shins he saw himselfgrovelling on the floor screaming for mercy through broken teeth hehardly thought of julia he could not fix his mind on her he loved herand would not betray her but that was only a fact known as he knew therules of arithmetic he felt no love for her and he hardly even wonderedwhat was happening to her he thought oftener of obrien with a flickeringhope obrien might know that he had been arrested the brotherhood hehad said never tried to save its members but there was the razor bladethey would send the razor blade if they could there would be perhaps fiveseconds before the guard could rush into the cell the blade would biteinto him with a sort of burning coldness and even the fingers that heldit would be cut to the bone everything came back to his sick body whichshrank trembling from the smallest pain he was not certain that he woulduse the razor blade even if he got the chance it was more natural to existfrom moment to moment accepting another ten minutes life even with thecertainty that there was torture at the end of itsometimes he tried to calculate the number of porcelain bricks in thewalls of the cell it should have been easy but he always lost count atsome point or another more often he wondered where he was and what timeof day it was at one moment he felt certain that it was broad daylightoutside and at the next equally certain that it was pitch darkness inthis place he knew instinctively the lights would never be turned outit was the place with no darkness he saw now why obrien had seemed torecognize the allusion in the ministry of love there were no windows hiscell might be at the heart of the building or against its outer wall itmight be ten floors below ground or thirty above it he moved himselfmentally from place to place and tried to determine by the feeling of hisbody whether he was perched high in the air or buried deep undergroundthere was a sound of marching boots outside the steel door opened witha clang a young officer a trim blackuniformed figure who seemed toglitter all over with polished leather and whose pale straightfeaturedface was like a wax mask stepped smartly through the doorway he motionedto the guards outside to bring in the prisoner they were leading thepoet ampleforth shambled into the cell the door clanged shut againampleforth made one or two uncertain movements from side to side asthough having some idea that there was another door to go out of and thenbegan to wander up and down the cell he had not yet noticed winstonspresence his troubled eyes were gazing at the wall about a metre abovethe level of winstons head he was shoeless large dirty toes weresticking out of the holes in his socks he was also several days awayfrom a shave a scrubby beard covered his face to the cheekbones givinghim an air of ruffianism that went oddly with his large weak frame andnervous movementswinston roused himself a little from his lethargy he must speakto ampleforth and risk the yell from the telescreen it was evenconceivable that ampleforth was the bearer of the razor bladeampleforth he saidthere was no yell from the telescreen ampleforth paused mildly startledhis eyes focused themselves slowly on winstonah smith he said you toowhat are you in forto tell you the truth he sat down awkwardly on the bench oppositewinston there is only one offence is there not he saidand have you committed itapparently i havehe put a hand to his forehead and pressed his temples for a moment asthough trying to remember somethingthese things happen he began vaguely i have been able to recall oneinstancea possible instance it was an indiscretion undoubtedly wewere producing a definitive edition of the poems of kipling i allowed theword god to remain at the end of a line i could not help it he addedalmost indignantly raising his face to look at winston it was impossibleto change the line the rhyme was rod do you realize that there are onlytwelve rhymes to rod in the entire language for days i had racked mybrains there was no other rhymethe expression on his face changed the annoyance passed out of it and fora moment he looked almost pleased a sort of intellectual warmth the joyof the pedant who has found out some useless fact shone through the dirtand scrubby hairhas it ever occurred to you he said that the whole history of englishpoetry has been determined by the fact that the english language lacksrhymesno that particular thought had never occurred to winston nor in thecircumstances did it strike him as very important or interestingdo you know what time of day it is he saidampleforth looked startled again i had hardly thought about it theyarrested meit could be two days agoperhaps three his eyes flittedround the walls as though he half expected to find a window somewherethere is no difference between night and day in this place i do not seehow one can calculate the timethey talked desultorily for some minutes then without apparent reasona yell from the telescreen bade them be silent winston sat quietly hishands crossed ampleforth too large to sit in comfort on the narrowbench fidgeted from side to side clasping his lank hands first round oneknee then round the other the telescreen barked at him to keep stilltime passed twenty minutes an hourit was difficult to judge once morethere was a sound of boots outside winstons entrails contracted soonvery soon perhaps in five minutes perhaps now the tramp of boots wouldmean that his own turn had comethe door opened the coldfaced young officer stepped into the cell witha brief movement of the hand he indicated ampleforthroom  he saidampleforth marched clumsily out between the guards his face vaguelyperturbed but uncomprehendingwhat seemed like a long time passed the pain in winstons belly hadrevived his mind sagged round and round on the same trick like a ballfalling again and again into the same series of slots he had only sixthoughts the pain in his belly a piece of bread the blood and thescreaming obrien julia the razor blade there was another spasm in hisentrails the heavy boots were approaching as the door opened the waveof air that it created brought in a powerful smell of cold sweat parsonswalked into the cell he was wearing khaki shorts and a sportsshirtthis time winston was startled into selfforgetfulnessyou here he saidparsons gave winston a glance in which there was neither interest norsurprise but only misery he began walking jerkily up and down evidentlyunable to keep still each time he straightened his pudgy knees it wasapparent that they were trembling his eyes had a wideopen staring lookas though he could not prevent himself from gazing at something in themiddle distancewhat are you in for said winstonthoughtcrime said parsons almost blubbering the tone of his voiceimplied at once a complete admission of his guilt and a sort of increduloushorror that such a word could be applied to himself he paused oppositewinston and began eagerly appealing to him you dont think theyll shootme do you old chap they dont shoot you if you havent actually doneanythingonly thoughts which you cant help i know they give you a fairhearing oh i trust them for that theyll know my record wont theyyou know what kind of chap i was not a bad chap in my way not brainy ofcourse but keen i tried to do my best for the party didnt i ill getoff with five years dont you think or even ten years a chap like mecould make himself pretty useful in a labourcamp they wouldnt shoot mefor going off the rails just onceare you guilty said winstonof course im guilty cried parsons with a servile glance at thetelescreen you dont think the party would arrest an innocent mando you his froglike face grew calmer and even took on a slightlysanctimonious expression thoughtcrime is a dreadful thing old manhe said sententiously its insidious it can get hold of you withoutyour even knowing it do you know how it got hold of me in my sleep yesthats a fact there i was working away trying to do my bitnever knewi had any bad stuff in my mind at all and then i started talking in mysleep do you know what they heard me sayinghe sank his voice like someone who is obliged for medical reasons toutter an obscenitydown with big brother yes i said that said it over and over againit

mebefore it was too latewho denounced you said winstonit was my little daughter said parsons with a sort of doleful prideshe listened at the keyhole heard what i was saying and nipped off tothe patrols the very next day pretty smart for a nipper of seven ehi dont bear her any grudge for it in fact im proud of her it shows ibrought her up in the right spirit anywayhe made a few more jerky movements up and down several times casting alonging glance at the lavatory pan then he suddenly ripped down hisshortsexcuse me old man he said i cant help it its the waitinghe plumped his large posterior into the lavatory pan winston covered hisface with his handssmith yelled the voice from the telescreen  smith w uncover yourface no faces covered in the cellswinston uncovered his face parsons used the lavatory loudly andabundantly it then turned out that the plug was defective and the cellstank abominably for hours afterwardsparsons was removed more prisoners came and went mysteriously one awoman was consigned to room  and winston noticed seemed to shriveland turn a different colour when she heard the words a time came when ifit had been morning when he was brought here it would be afternoon or ifit had been afternoon then it would be midnight there were six prisonersin the cell men and women all sat very still opposite winston there sata man with a chinless toothy face exactly like that of some largeharmless rodent his fat mottled cheeks were so pouched at the bottomthat it was difficult not to believe that he had little stores of foodtucked away there his palegrey eyes flitted timorously from face to faceand turned quickly away again when he caught anyones eyethe door opened and another prisoner was brought in whose appearance senta momentary chill through winston he was a commonplace meanlooking manwho might have been an engineer or technician of some kind but what wasstartling was the emaciation of his face it was like a skull because ofits thinness the mouth and eyes looked disproportionately large and theeyes seemed filled with a murderous unappeasable hatred of somebody orsomethingthe man sat down on the bench at a little distance from winston winstondid not look at him again but the tormented skulllike face was asvivid in his mind as though it had been straight in front of his eyessuddenly he realized what was the matter the man was dying of starvationthe same thought seemed to occur almost simultaneously to everyone in thecell there was a very faint stirring all the way round the bench theeyes of the chinless man kept flitting towards the skullfaced man thenturning guiltily away then being dragged back by an irresistibleattraction presently he began to fidget on his seat at last he stood upwaddled clumsily across the cell dug down into the pocket of his overallsand with an abashed air held out a grimy piece of bread to theskullfaced manthere was a furious deafening roar from the telescreen the chinless manjumped in his tracks the skullfaced man had quickly thrust his handsbehind his back as though demonstrating to all the world that he refusedthe giftbumstead roared the voice  bumstead j let fall that piece ofbreadthe chinless man dropped the piece of bread on the floorremain standing where you are said the voice face the door make nomovementthe chinless man obeyed his large pouchy cheeks were quiveringuncontrollably the door clanged open as the young officer entered andstepped aside there emerged from behind him a short stumpy guard withenormous arms and shoulders he took his stand opposite the chinless manand then at a signal from the officer let free a frightful blow withall the weight of his body behind it full in the chinless mans mouththe force of it seemed almost to knock him clear of the floor his bodywas flung across the cell and fetched up against the base of the lavatoryseat for a moment he lay as though stunned with dark blood oozing fromhis mouth and nose a very faint whimpering or squeaking which seemedunconscious came out of him then he rolled over and raised himselfunsteadily on hands and knees amid a stream of blood and saliva the twohalves of a dental plate fell out of his mouththe prisoners sat very still their hands crossed on their knees thechinless man climbed back into his place down one side of his face theflesh was darkening his mouth had swollen into a shapeless cherrycolouredmass with a black hole in the middle of itfrom time to time a little blood dripped on to the breast of his overallshis grey eyes still flitted from face to face more guiltily than everas though he were trying to discover how much the others despised him forhis humiliationthe door opened with a small gesture the officer indicated theskullfaced manroom  he saidthere was a gasp and a flurry at winstons side the man had actuallyflung himself on his knees on the floor with his hand clasped togethercomrade officer he cried you dont have to take me to that placehavent i told you everything already what else is it you want to knowtheres nothing i wouldnt confess nothing just tell me what it is andill confess straight off write it down and ill sign itanythingnot room room  said the officerthe mans face already very pale turned a colour winston would not havebelieved possible it was definitely unmistakably a shade of greendo anything to me he yelled youve been starving me for weeks finishit off and let me die shoot me hang me sentence me to twentyfiveyears is there somebody else you want me to give away just say who it isand ill tell you anything you want i dont care who it is or what you doto them ive got a wife and three children the biggest of them isnt sixyears old you can take the whole lot of them and cut their throats infront of my eyes and ill stand by and watch it but not room room  said the officerthe man looked frantically round at the other prisoners as though withsome idea that he could put another victim in his own place his eyessettled on the smashed face of the chinless man he flung out a lean armthats the one you ought to be taking not me he shouted you didnthear what he was saying after they bashed his face give me a chance andill tell you every word of it hes the one thats against the party notme the guards stepped forward the mans voice rose to a shriek youdidnt hear him he repeated something went wrong with the telescreenhes the one you want take him not methe two sturdy guards had stooped to take him by the arms but just atthis moment he flung himself across the floor of the cell and grabbed oneof the iron legs that supported the bench he had set up a wordlesshowling like an animal the guards took hold of him to wrench him loosebut he clung on with astonishing strength for perhaps twenty secondsthey were hauling at him the prisoners sat quiet their hands crossed ontheir knees looking straight in front of them the howling stopped theman had no breath left for anything except hanging on then there was adifferent kind of cry a kick from a guards boot had broken the fingersof one of his hands they dragged him to his feetroom  said the officerthe man was led out walking unsteadily with head sunken nursing hiscrushed hand all the fight had gone out of hima long time passed if it had been midnight when the skullfaced man wastaken away it was morning if morning it was afternoon winston wasalone and had been alone for hours the pain of sitting on the narrowbench was such that often he got up and walked about unreproved by thetelescreen the piece of bread still lay where the chinless man haddropped it at the beginning it needed a hard effort not to look at itbut presently hunger gave way to thirst his mouth was sticky andeviltasting the humming sound and the unvarying white light induced asort of faintness an empty feeling inside his head he would get upbecause the ache in his bones was no longer bearable and then would sitdown again almost at once because he was too dizzy to make sure ofstaying on his feet whenever his physical sensations were a little undercontrol the terror returned sometimes with a fading hope he thought ofobrien and the razor blade it was thinkable that the razor blade mightarrive concealed in his food if he were ever fed more dimly he thoughtof julia somewhere or other she was suffering perhaps far worse than heshe might be screaming with pain at this moment he thought if i couldsave julia by doubling my own pain would i do it yes i would but thatwas merely an intellectual decision taken because he knew that he oughtto take it he did not feel it in this place you could not feel anythingexcept pain and foreknowledge of pain besides was it possible when youwere actually suffering it to wish for any reason that your own painshould increase but that question was not answerable yetthe boots were approaching again the door opened obrien came inwinston started to his feet the shock of the sight had driven allcaution out of him for the first time in many years he forgot thepresence of the telescreentheyve got you too he criedthey got me a long time ago said obrien with a mild almost regretfulirony he stepped aside from behind him there emerged a broadchestedguard with a long black truncheon in his handyou know this winston said obrien dont deceive yourself you didknow ityou have always known ityes he saw now he had always known it but there was no time to think ofthat all he had eyes for was the truncheon in the guards hand it mightfall anywhere on the crown on the tip of the ear on the upper arm onthe elbowthe elbow he had slumped to his knees almost paralysed clasping thestricken elbow with his other hand everything had exploded into yellowlight inconceivable inconceivable that one blow could cause such painthe light cleared and he could see the other two looking down at him theguard was laughing at his contortions one question at any rate wasanswered never for any reason on earth could you wish for an increaseof pain of pain you could wish only one thing that it should stopnothing in the world was so bad as physical pain in the face of painthere are no heroes no heroes he thought over and over as he writhedon the floor clutching uselessly at his disabled left armchapter he was lying on something that felt like a camp bed except that it washigher off the ground and that he was fixed down in some way so that hecould not move light that seemed stronger than usual was falling on hisface obrien was standing at his side looking down at him intently atthe other side of him stood a man in a white coat holding a hypodermicsyringeeven after his eyes were open he took in his surroundings only graduallyhe had the impression of swimming up into this room from some quitedifferent world a sort of underwater world far beneath it how long hehad been down there he did not know since the moment when they arrestedhim he had not seen darkness or daylight besides his memories were notcontinuous there had been times when consciousness even the sort ofconsciousness that one has in sleep had stopped dead and started againafter a blank interval but whether the intervals were of days or weeksor only seconds there was no way of knowingwith that first blow on the elbow the nightmare had started later he wasto realize that all that then happened was merely a preliminary a routineinterrogation to which nearly all prisoners were subjected there was along range of crimesespionage sabotage and the liketo which everyonehad to confess as a matter of course the confession was a formalitythough the torture was real how many times he had been beaten how longthe beatings had continued he could not remember always there were fiveor six men in black uniforms at him simultaneously sometimes it wasfists sometimes it was truncheons sometimes it was steel rods sometimesit was boots there were times when he rolled about the floor as shamelessas an animal writhing his body this way and that in an endless hopelesseffort to dodge the kicks and simply inviting more and yet more kicksin his ribs in his belly on his elbows on his shins in his groinin his testicles on the bone at the base of his spine there were timeswhen it went on and on until the cruel wicked unforgivable thing seemedto him not that the guards continued to beat him but that he could notforce himself into losing consciousness there were times when his nerveso forsook him that he began shouting for mercy even before the beatingbegan when the mere sight of a fist drawn back for a blow was enoughto make him pour forth a confession of real and imaginary crimes therewere other times when he started out with the resolve of confessingnothing when every word had to be forced out of him between gasps ofpain and there were times when he feebly tried to compromise when hesaid to himself i will confess but not yet i must hold out till thepain becomes unbearable three more kicks two more kicks and then i willtell them what they want sometimes he was beaten till he could hardlystand then flung like a sack of potatoes on to the stone floor of a cellleft to recuperate for a few hours and then taken out and beaten againthere were also longer periods of recovery he remembered them dimlybecause they were spent chiefly in sleep or stupor he remembered a cellwith a plank bed a sort of shelf sticking out from the wall and a tinwashbasin and meals of hot soup and bread and sometimes coffee heremembered a surly barber arriving to scrape his chin and crop his hairand businesslike unsympathetic men in white coats feeling his pulsetapping his reflexes turning up his eyelids running harsh fingers overhim in search for broken bones and shooting needles into his arm to makehim sleepthe beatings grew less frequent and became mainly a threat a horrorto which he could be sent back at any moment when his answers wereunsatisfactory his questioners now were not ruffians in black uniformsbut party intellectuals little rotund men with quick movements andflashing spectacles who worked on him in relays over periods whichlastedhe thought he could not be sureten or twelve hours at a stretchthese other questioners saw to it that he was in constant slight pain butit was not chiefly pain that they relied on they slapped his face wrunghis ears pulled his hair made him stand on one leg refused him leave tourinate shone glaring lights in his face until his eyes ran with waterbut the aim of this was simply to humiliate him and destroy his power ofarguing and reasoning their real weapon was the merciless questioningthat went on and on hour after hour tripping him up laying traps forhim twisting everything that he said convicting him at every step oflies and selfcontradiction until he began weeping as much from shame asfrom nervous fatigue sometimes he would weep half a dozen times in asingle session most of the time they screamed abuse at him and threatenedat every hesitation to deliver him over to the guards again but sometimesthey would suddenly change their tune call him comrade appeal to him inthe name of ingsoc and big brother and ask him sorrowfully whether evennow he had not enough loyalty to the party left to make him wish toundo the evil he had done when his nerves were in rags after hours ofquestioning even this appeal could reduce him to snivelling tears in theend the nagging voices broke him down more completely than the boots andfists of the guards he became simply a mouth that uttered a hand thatsigned whatever was demanded of him his sole concern was to find outwhat they wanted him to confess and then confess it quickly before thebullying started anew he confessed to the assassination of eminent partymembers the distribution of seditious pamphlets embezzlement of publicfunds sale of military secrets sabotage of every kind he confessed thathe had been a spy in the pay of the eastasian government as far back as he confessed that he was a religious believer an admirer ofcapitalism and a sexual pervert he confessed that he had murdered hiswife although he knew and his questioners must have known that his wifewas still alive he confessed that for years he had been in personal touchwith goldstein and had been a member of an underground organization whichhad included almost every human being he had ever known it was easier toconfess everything and implicate everybody besides in a sense it was alltrue it was true that he had been the enemy of the party and in the eyesof the party there was no distinction between the thought and the deedthere were also memories of another kind they stood out in his minddisconnectedly like pictures with blackness all round themhe was in a cell which might have been either dark or light because hecould see nothing except a pair of eyes near at hand some kind ofinstrument was ticking slowly and regularly the eyes grew larger and moreluminous suddenly he floated out of his seat dived into the eyes andwas swallowed uphe was strapped into a chair surrounded by dials under dazzling lightsa man in a white coat was reading the dials there was a tramp of heavyboots outside the door clanged open the waxedfaced officer marched infollowed by two guardsroom  said the officerthe man in the white coat did not turn round he did not look at winstoneither he was looking only at the dialshe was rolling down a mighty corridor a kilometre wide full of gloriousgolden light roaring with laughter and shouting out confessions at thetop of his voice he was confessing everything even the things he hadsucceeded in holding back under the torture he was relating the entirehistory of his life to an audience who knew it already with him were theguards the other questioners the men in white coats obrien juliamr charrington all rolling down the corridor together and shouting withlaughter some dreadful thing which had lain embedded in the future hadsomehow been skipped over and had not happened everything was all rightthere was no more pain the last detail of his life was laid bareunderstood forgivenhe was starting up from the plank bed in the halfcertainty that he hadheard obriens voice all through his interrogation although he hadnever seen him he had had the feeling that obrien was at his elbow justout of sight it was obrien who was directing everything it was he whoset the guards on to winston and who prevented them from killing him itwas he who decided when winston should scream with pain when he shouldhave a respite when he should be fed when he should sleep when thedrugs should be pumped into his arm it was he who asked the questions andsuggested the answers he was the tormentor he was the protector he wasthe inquisitor he was the friend and oncewinston could not rememberwhether it was in drugged sleep or in normal sleep or even in a momentof wakefulnessa voice murmured in his ear dont worry winston youare in my keeping for seven years i have watched over you now theturningpoint has come i shall save you i shall make you perfect hewas not sure whether it was obriens voice but it was the same voicethat had said to him we shall meet in the place where there is nodarkness in that other dream seven years agohe did not remember any ending to his interrogation there was a period ofblackness and then the cell or room in which he now was had graduallymaterialized round him he was almost flat on his back and unable to movehis body was held down at every essential point even the back of his headwas gripped in some manner obrien was looking down at him gravely andrather sadly his face seen from below looked coarse and worn withpouches under the eyes and tired lines from nose to chin he was olderthan winston had thought him he was perhaps fortyeight or fifty underhis hand there was a dial with a lever on top and figures running roundthe facei told you said obrien that if we met again it would be hereyes said winstonwithout any warning except a slight movement of obriens hand a wave ofpain flooded his body it was a frightening pain because he could not seewhat was happening and he had the feeling that some mortal injury wasbeing done to him he did not know whether the thing was really happeningor whether the effect was electrically produced but his body was beingwrenched out of shape the joints were being slowly torn apart althoughthe pain had brought the sweat out on his forehead the worst of all wasthe fear that his backbone was about to snap he set his teeth andbreathed hard through his nose trying to keep silent as long as possibleyou are afraid said obrien watching his face that in another momentsomething is going to break your especial fear is that it will be yourbackbone you have a vivid mental picture of the vertebrae snapping apartand the spinal fluid dripping out of them that is what you are thinkingis it not winstonwinston did not answer obrien drew back the lever on the dial the waveof pain receded almost as quickly as it had comethat was forty said obrien you can see that the numbers on this dialrun up to a hundred will you please remember throughout our conversationthat i have it in my power to inflict pain on you at any moment and towhatever degree i choose if you tell me any lies or attempt toprevaricate in any way or even fall below your usual level ofintelligence you will cry out with pain instantly do you understandthatyes said winstonobriens manner became less severe he resettled his spectaclesthoughtfully and took a pace or two up and down when he spoke his voicewas gentle and patient he had the air of a doctor a teacher even apriest anxious to explain and persuade rather than to punishi am taking trouble with you winston he said because you are worthtrouble you know perfectly well what is the matter with you you haveknown it for years though you have fought against the knowledge you arementally deranged you suffer from a defective memory you are unable toremember real events and you persuade yourself that you remember otherevents which never happened fortunately it is curable you have nevercured yourself of it because you did not choose to there was a smalleffort of the will that you were not ready to make even now i am wellaware you are clinging to your disease under the impression that it isa virtue now we will take an example at this moment which power isoceania at war withwhen i was arrested oceania was at war with eastasiawith eastasia good and oceania has always been at war with eastasiahas it notwinston drew in his breath he opened his mouth to speak and then did notspeak he could not take his eyes away from the dialthe truth please winston your truth tell me what you think yourememberi remember that until only a week before i was arrested we were not atwar with eastasia at all we were in alliance with them the war wasagainst eurasia that had lasted for four years before thatobrien stopped him with a movement of the handanother example he said some years ago you had a very serious delusionindeed you believed that three men three onetime party members namedjones aaronson and rutherfordmen who were executed for treachery andsabotage after making the fullest possible confessionwere not guilty ofthe crimes they were charged with you believed that you had seenunmistakable documentary evidence proving that their confessions werefalse there was a certain photograph about which you had a hallucinationyou believed that you had actually held it in your hands it was aphotograph something like thisan oblong slip of newspaper had appeared between obriens fingers forperhaps five seconds it was within the angle of winstons vision it wasa photograph and there was no question of its identity it was thephotograph it was another copy of the photograph of jones aaronson andrutherford at the party function in new york which he had chanced uponeleven years ago and promptly destroyed for only an instant it was beforehis eyes then it was out of sight again but he had seen itunquestionably he had seen it he made a desperate agonizing effort towrench the top half of his body free it was impossible to move so much asa centimetre in any direction for the moment he had even forgotten thedial all he wanted was to hold the photograph in his fingers again or atleast to see itit exists he criedno said obrienhe stepped across the room there was a memory hole in the opposite wallobrien lifted the grating unseen the frail slip of paper was whirlingaway on the current of warm air it was vanishing in a flash of flameobrien turned away from the wallashes he said not even identifiable ashes dust it does not existit never existedbut it did exist it does exist it exists in memory i remember ityou remember iti do not remember it said obrienwinstons heart sank that was doublethink he had a feeling of deadlyhelplessness if he could have been certain that obrien was lying itwould not have seemed to matter but it was perfectly possible that obrienhad really forgotten the photograph and if so then already he would haveforgotten his denial of remembering it and forgotten the act offorgetting how could one be sure that it was simple trickery perhapsthat lunatic dislocation in the mind could really happen that was thethought that defeated himobrien was looking down at him speculatively more than ever he had theair of a teacher taking pains with a wayward but promising childthere is a party slogan dealing with the control of the past he saidrepeat it if you pleasewho controls the past controls the future who controls the presentcontrols the past repeated winston obedientlywho controls the present controls the past said obrien nodding hishead with slow approval is it your opinion winston that the past hasreal existenceagain the feeling of helplessness descended upon winston his eyes flittedtowards the dial he not only did not know whether yes or no was theanswer that would save him from pain he did not even know which answer hebelieved to be the true oneobrien smiled faintly you are no metaphysician winston he saiduntil this moment you had never considered what is meant by existence iwill put it more precisely does the past exist concretely in space isthere somewhere or other a place a world of solid objects where the pastis still happeningnothen where does the past exist if at allin records it is written downin records andin the mind in human memoriesin memory very well then we the party control all records and wecontrol all memories then we control the past do we notbut how can you stop people remembering things cried winston againmomentarily forgetting the dial it is involuntary it is outside oneselfhow can you control memory you have not controlled mineobriens manner grew stern again he laid his hand on the dialon the contrary he said you have not controlled it that is what hasbrought you here you are here because you have failed in humility inselfdiscipline you would not make the act of submission which is theprice of sanity you preferred to be a lunatic a minority of one only thedisciplined mind can see reality winston you believe that reality issomething objective external existing in its own right you also believethat the nature of reality is selfevident when you delude yourself intothinking that you see something you assume that everyone else sees thesame thing as you but i tell you winston that reality is not externalreality exists in the human mind and nowhere else not in the individualmind which can make mistakes and in any case soon perishes only in themind of the party which is collective and immortal whatever the partyholds to be the truth is truth it is impossible to see reality except bylooking through the eyes of the party that is the fact that you have gotto relearn winston it needs an act of selfdestruction an effort of thewill you must humble yourself before you can become sanehe paused for a few moments as though to allow what he had been saying tosink indo you remember he went on writing in your diary freedom is thefreedom to say that two plus two make fouryes said winstonobrien held up his left hand its back towards winston with the thumbhidden and the four fingers extendedhow many fingers am i holding up winstonfourand if the party says that it is not four but fivethen how manyfourthe word ended in a gasp of pain the needle of the dial had shot up tofiftyfive the sweat had sprung out all over winstons body the air toreinto his lungs and issued again in deep groans which even by clenching histeeth he could not stop obrien watched him the four fingers stillextended he drew back the lever this time the pain was only slightlyeasedhow many fingers winstonfourthe needle went up to sixtyhow many fingers winstonfour four what else can i say fourthe needle must have risen again but he did not look at it the heavystern face and the four fingers filled his vision the fingers stood upbefore his eyes like pillars enormous blurry and seeming to vibratebut unmistakably fourhow many fingers winstonfour stop it stop it how can you go on four fourhow many fingers winstonfive five fiveno winston that is no use you are lying you still think there arefour how many fingers pleasefour five four anything you like only stop it stop the painabruptly he was sitting up with obriens arm round his shoulders he hadperhaps lost consciousness for a few seconds the bonds that had held hisbody down were loosened he felt very cold he was shaking uncontrollablyhis teeth were chattering the tears were rolling down his cheeks for amoment he clung to obrien like a baby curiously comforted by the heavyarm round his shoulders he had the feeling that obrien was his protectorthat the pain was something that came from outside from some other sourceand that it was obrien who would save him from ityou are a slow learner winston said obrien gentlyhow can i help it he blubbered how can i help seeing what is in frontof my eyes two and two are foursometimes winston sometimes they are five sometimes they are threesometimes they are all of them at once you must try harder it is noteasy to become sanehe laid winston down on the bed the grip of his limbs tightened againbut the pain had ebbed away and the trembling had stopped leaving himmerely weak and cold obrien motioned with his head to the man in thewhite coat who had stood immobile throughout the proceedings the man inthe white coat bent down and looked closely into winstons eyes felt hispulse laid an ear against his chest tapped here and there then henodded to obrienagain said obrienthe pain flowed into winstons body the needle must be at seventyseventyfive he had shut his eyes this time he knew that the fingerswere still there and still four all that mattered was somehow to stayalive until the spasm was over he had ceased to notice whether he wascrying out or not the pain lessened again he opened his eyes obrienhad drawn back the leverhow many fingers winstonfour i suppose there are four i would see five if i could i am tryingto see fivewhich do you wish to persuade me that you see five or really to seethemreally to see themagain said obrienperhaps the needle was eightyninety winston could not intermittentlyremember why the pain was happening behind his screwedup eyelids aforest of fingers seemed to be moving in a sort of dance weaving in andout disappearing behind one another and reappearing again he was tryingto count them he could not remember why he knew only that it wasimpossible to count them and that this was somehow due to the mysteriousidentity between five and four the pain died down again when he openedhis eyes it was to find that he was still seeing the same thinginnumerable fingers like moving trees were still streaming past ineither direction crossing and recrossing he shut his eyes againhow many fingers am i holding up winstoni dont know i dont know you will kill me if you do that again fourfive sixin all honesty i dont knowbetter said obriena needle slid into winstons arm almost in the same instant a blissfulhealing warmth spread all through his body the pain was alreadyhalfforgotten he opened his eyes and looked up gratefully at obrienat sight of the heavy lined face so ugly and so intelligent his heartseemed to turn over if he could have moved he would have stretched outa hand and laid it on obriens arm he had never loved him so deeply asat this moment and not merely because he had stopped the pain the oldfeeling that at bottom it did not matter whether obrien was a friendor an enemy had come back obrien was a person who could be talked toperhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood obrienhad tortured him to the edge of lunacy and in a little while it wascertain he would send him to his death it made no difference in somesense that went deeper than friendship they were intimates somewhere orother although the actual words might never be spoken there was a placewhere they could meet and talk obrien was looking down at him with anexpression which suggested that the same thought might be in his own mindwhen he spoke it was in an easy conversational tonedo you know where you are winston he saidi dont know i can guess in the ministry of lovedo you know how long you have been herei dont know days weeks monthsi think it is monthsand why do you imagine that we bring people to this placeto make them confessno that is not the reason try againto punish themno exclaimed obrien his voice had changed extraordinarily and hisface had suddenly become both stern and animated no not merely toextract your confession not to punish you shall i tell you why we havebrought you here to cure you to make you sane will you understandwinston that no one whom we bring to this place ever leaves our handsuncured we are not interested in those stupid crimes that you havecommitted the party is not interested in the overt act the thought isall we care about we do not merely destroy our enemies we change themdo you understand what i mean by thathe was bending over winston his face looked enormous because of itsnearness and hideously ugly because it was seen from below moreover itwas filled with a sort of exaltation a lunatic intensity again winstonsheart shrank if it had been possible he would have cowered deeper intothe bed he felt certain that obrien was about to twist the dial out ofsheer wantonness at this moment however obrien turned away he took apace or two up and down then he continued less vehementlythe first thing for you to understand is that in this place there are nomartyrdoms you have read of the religious persecutions of the past inthe middle ages there was the inquisition it was a failure it set outto eradicate heresy and ended by perpetuating it for every heretic itburned at the stake thousands of others rose up why was that becausethe inquisition killed its enemies in the open and killed them whilethey were still unrepentant in fact it killed them because they wereunrepentant men were dying because they would not abandon their truebeliefs naturally all the glory belonged to the victim and all the shameto the inquisitor who burned him later in the twentieth century therewere the totalitarians as they were called there were the german nazisand the russian communists the russians persecuted heresy more cruellythan the inquisition had done and they imagined that they had learnedfrom the mistakes of the past they knew at any rate that one must notmake martyrs before they exposed their victims to public trial theydeliberately set themselves to destroy their dignity they wore them downby torture and solitude until they were despicable cringing wretchesconfessing whatever was put into their mouths covering themselves withabuse accusing and sheltering behind one another whimpering for mercyand yet after only a few years the same thing had happened over againthe dead men had become martyrs and their degradation was forgotten onceagain why was it in the first place because the confessions that theyhad made were obviously extorted and untrue we do not make mistakes ofthat kind all the confessions that are uttered here are true we makethem true and above all we do not allow the dead to rise up against usyou must stop imagining that posterity will vindicate you winstonposterity will never hear of you you will be lifted clean out from thestream of history we shall turn you into gas and pour you into thestratosphere nothing will remain of you not a name in a register nota memory in a living brain you will be annihilated in the past as wellas in the future you will never have existedthen why bother to torture me thought winston with a momentarybitterness obrien checked his step as though winston had uttered thethought aloud his large ugly face came nearer with the eyes a littlenarrowedyou are thinking he said that since we intend to destroy you utterlyso that nothing that you say or do can make the smallest differenceinthat case why do we go to the trouble of interrogating you first that iswhat you were thinking was it notyes said winstonobrien smiled slightly you are a flaw in the pattern winston you area stain that must be wiped out did i not tell you just now that we aredifferent from the persecutors of the past we are not content withnegative obedience nor even with the most abject submission when finallyyou surrender to us it must be of your own free will we do not destroythe heretic because he resists us so long as he resists us we neverdestroy him we convert him we capture his inner mind we reshape himwe burn all evil and all illusion out of him we bring him over to ourside not in appearance but genuinely heart and soul we make him one ofourselves before we kill him it is intolerable to us that an erroneousthought should exist anywhere in the world however secret and powerlessit may be even in the instant of death we cannot permit any deviation inthe old days the heretic walked to the stake still a heretic proclaiminghis heresy exulting in it even the victim of the russian purges couldcarry rebellion locked up in his skull as he walked down the passagewaiting for the bullet but we make the brain perfect before we blow itout the command of the old despotisms was thou shalt not the commandof the totalitarians was thou shalt our command is thou art no onewhom we bring to this place ever stands out against us everyone is washedclean even those three miserable traitors in whose innocence you oncebelievedjones aaronson and rutherfordin the end we broke them downi took part in their interrogation myself i saw them gradually worn downwhimpering grovelling weepingand in the end it was not with pain orfear only with penitence by the time we had finished with them they wereonly the shells of men there was nothing left in them except sorrow forwhat they had done and love of big brother it was touching to seehow they loved him they begged to be shot quickly so that they could diewhile their minds were still cleanhis voice had grown almost dreamy the exaltation the lunatic enthusiasmwas still in his face he is not pretending thought winston he is not ahypocrite he believes every word he says what most oppressed him was theconsciousness of his own intellectual inferiority he watched the heavyyet graceful form strolling to and fro in and out of the range of hisvision obrien was a being in all ways larger than himself there was noidea that he had ever had or could have that obrien had not long agoknown examined and rejected his mind contained winstons mind butin that case how could it be true that obrien was mad it must be hewinston who was mad obrien halted and looked down at him his voice hadgrown stern againdo not imagine that you will save yourself winston however completelyyou surrender to us no one who has once gone astray is ever spared andeven if we chose to let you live out the natural term of your life stillyou would never escape from us what happens to you here is for everunderstand that in advance we shall crush you down to the point fromwhich there is no coming back things will happen to you from which youcould not recover if you lived a thousand years never again will you becapable of ordinary human feeling everything will be dead inside younever again will you be capable of love or friendship or joy of livingor laughter or curiosity or courage or integrity you will be hollowwe shall squeeze you empty and then we shall fill you with ourselveshe paused and signed to the man in the white coat winston was aware ofsome heavy piece of apparatus being pushed into place behind his headobrien had sat down beside the bed so that his face was almost on alevel with winstonsthree thousand he said speaking over winstons head to the man in thewhite coattwo soft pads which felt slightly moist clamped themselves againstwinstons temples he quailed there was pain coming a new kind of painobrien laid a hand reassuringly almost kindly on histhis time it will not hurt he said keep your eyes fixed on mineat this moment there was a devastating explosion or what seemed like anexplosion though it was not certain whether there was any noise therewas undoubtedly a blinding flash of light winston was not hurt onlyprostrated although he had already been lying on his back when the thinghappened he had a curious feeling that he had been knocked into thatposition a terrific painless blow had flattened him out also somethinghad happened inside his head as his eyes regained their focus heremembered who he was and where he was and recognized the face that wasgazing into his own but somewhere or other there was a large patch ofemptiness as though a piece had been taken out of his brainit will not last said obrien look me in the eyes what country isoceania at war withwinston thought he knew what was meant by oceania and that he himself wasa citizen of oceania he also remembered eurasia and eastasia but who wasat war with whom he did not know in fact he had not been aware that therewas any wari dont rememberoceania is at war with eastasia do you remember that nowyesoceania has always been at war with eastasia since the beginning of yourlife since the beginning of the party since the beginning of historythe war has continued without a break always the same war do youremember thatyeseleven years ago you created a legend about three men who had beencondemned to death for treachery you pretended that you had seen a pieceof paper which proved them innocent no such piece of paper ever existedyou invented it and later you grew to believe in it you remember now thevery moment at which you first invented it do you remember thatyesjust now i held up the fingers of my hand to you you saw five fingersdo you remember thatyesobrien held up the fingers of his left hand with the thumb concealedthere are five fingers there do you see five fingersyesand he did see them for a fleeting instant before the scenery of hismind changed he saw five fingers and there was no deformity theneverything was normal again and the old fear the hatred and thebewilderment came crowding back again but there had been a momenthe didnot know how long thirty seconds perhapsof luminous certainty wheneach new suggestion of obriens had filled up a patch of emptiness andbecome absolute truth and when two and two could have been three aseasily as five if that were what was needed it had faded but beforeobrien had dropped his hand but though he could not recapture it hecould remember it as one remembers a vivid experience at some period ofones life when one was in effect a different personyou see now said obrien that it is at any rate possibleyes said winstonobrien stood up with a satisfied air over to his left winston saw theman in the white coat break an ampoule and draw back the plunger of asyringe obrien turned to winston with a smile in almost the old mannerhe resettled his spectacles on his nosedo you remember writing in your diary he said that it did not matterwhether i was a friend or an enemy since i was at least a person whounderstood you and could be talked to you were right i enjoy talking toyou your mind appeals to me it resembles my own mind except that youhappen to be insane before we bring the session to an end you can ask mea few questions if you chooseany question i likeanything he saw that winstons eyes were upon the dial it is switchedoff what is your first questionwhat have you done with julia said winstonobrien smiled again she betrayed you winston immediatelyunreservedlyi have seldom seen anyone come over to us so promptly you would hardlyrecognize her if you saw her all her rebelliousness her deceit herfolly her dirtymindednesseverything has been burned out of her it wasa perfect conversion a textbook caseyou tortured herobrien left this unanswered next question he saiddoes big brother existof course he exists the party exists big brother is the embodiment ofthe partydoes he exist in the same way as i existyou do not exist said obrienonce again the sense of helplessness assailed him he knew or he couldimagine the arguments which proved his own nonexistence but they werenonsense they were only a play on words did not the statement you donot exist contain a logical absurdity but what use was it to say sohis mind shrivelled as he thought of the unanswerable mad arguments withwhich obrien would demolish himi think i exist he said wearily i am conscious of my own identityi was born and i shall die i have arms and legs i occupy a particularpoint in space no other solid object can occupy the same pointsimultaneously in that sense does big brother existit is of no importance he existswill big brother ever dieof course not how could he die next questiondoes the brotherhood existthat winston you will never know if we choose to set you free when wehave finished with you and if you live to be ninety years old still youwill never learn whether the answer to that question is yes or no as longas you live it will be an unsolved riddle in your mindwinston lay silent his breast rose and fell a little faster he still hadnot asked the question that had come into his mind the first he had gotto ask it and yet it was as though his tongue would not utter it therewas a trace of amusement in obriens face even his spectacles seemed towear an ironical gleam he knows thought winston suddenly he knows whati am going to ask at the thought the words burst out of himwhat is in room the expression on obriens face did not change he answered drilyyou know what is in room  winston everyone knows what is inroom he raised a finger to the man in the white coat evidently the session wasat an end a needle jerked into winstons arm he sank almost instantlyinto deep sleepchapter there are three stages in your reintegration said obrien there islearning there is understanding and there is acceptance it is time foryou to enter upon the second stageas always winston was lying flat on his back but of late his bonds werelooser they still held him to the bed but he could move his knees alittle and could turn his head from side to side and raise his arms fromthe elbow the dial also had grown to be less of a terror he couldevade its pangs if he was quickwitted enough it was chiefly when heshowed stupidity that obrien pulled the lever sometimes they got througha whole session without use of the dial he could not remember how manysessions there had been the whole process seemed to stretch out over along indefinite timeweeks possiblyand the intervals between thesessions might sometimes have been days sometimes only an hour or twoas you lie there said obrien you have often wonderedyou have evenasked mewhy the ministry of love should expend so much time and troubleon you and when you were free you were puzzled by what was essentiallythe same question you could grasp the mechanics of the society you livedin but not its underlying motives do you remember writing in your diaryi understand how i do not understand why it was when you thought aboutwhy that you doubted your own sanity you have read the bookgoldsteins book or parts of it at least did it tell you anything thatyou did not know alreadyyou have read it said winstoni wrote it that is to say i collaborated in writing it no book isproduced individually as you knowis it true what it saysas description yes the programme it sets forth is nonsense the secretaccumulation of knowledgea gradual spread of enlightenmentultimatelya proletarian rebellionthe overthrow of the party you foresaw yourselfthat that was what it would say it is all nonsense the proletarians willnever revolt not in a thousand years or a million they cannot i donot have to tell you the reason you know it already if you have evercherished any dreams of violent insurrection you must abandon them thereis no way in which the party can be overthrown the rule of the party isfor ever make that the startingpoint of your thoughtshe came closer to the bed for ever he repeated and now let us getback to the question of how and why you understand well enough howthe party maintains itself in power now tell me why we cling to powerwhat is our motive why should we want power go on speak he added aswinston remained silentnevertheless winston did not speak for another moment or two a feeling ofweariness had overwhelmed him the faint mad gleam of enthusiasm had comeback into obriens face he knew in advance what obrien would say thatthe party did not seek power for its own ends but only for the good ofthe majority that it sought power because men in the mass were frailcowardly creatures who could not endure liberty or face the truth andmust be ruled over and systematically deceived by others who were strongerthan themselves that the choice for mankind lay between freedom andhappiness and that for the great bulk of mankind happiness was betterthat the party was the eternal guardian of the weak a dedicated sectdoing evil that good might come sacrificing its own happiness to that ofothers the terrible thing thought winston the terrible thing was thatwhen obrien said this he would believe it you could see it in his faceobrien knew everything a thousand times better than winston he knew whatthe world was really like in what degradation the mass of human beingslived and by what lies and barbarities the party kept them there he hadunderstood it all weighed it all and it made no difference all wasjustified by the ultimate purpose what can you do thought winstonagainst the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself who gives yourarguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacyyou are ruling over us for our own good he said feebly you believethat human beings are not fit to govern themselves and thereforehe started and almost cried out a pang of pain had shot through his bodyobrien had pushed the lever of the dial up to thirtyfivethat was stupid winston stupid he said you should know better thanto say a thing like thathe pulled the lever back and continuednow i will tell you the answer to my question it is this the partyseeks power entirely for its own sake we are not interested in the goodof others we are interested solely in power not wealth or luxury or longlife or happiness only power pure power what pure power means you willunderstand presently we are different from all the oligarchies of thepast in that we know what we are doing all the others even those whoresembled ourselves were cowards and hypocrites the german nazis and therussian communists came very close to us in their methods but they neverhad the courage to recognize their own motives they pretended perhapsthey even believed that they had seized power unwillingly and for alimited time and that just round the corner there lay a paradise wherehuman beings would be free and equal we are not like that we know thatno one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it power isnot a means it is an end one does not establish a dictatorship in orderto safeguard a revolution one makes the revolution in order to establishthe dictatorship the object of persecution is persecution the object oftorture is torture the object of power is power now do you begin tounderstand mewinston was struck as he had been struck before by the tiredness ofobriens face it was strong and fleshy and brutal it was full ofintelligence and a sort of controlled passion before which he felt himselfhelpless but it was tired there were pouches under the eyes the skinsagged from the cheekbones obrien leaned over him deliberately bringingthe worn face neareryou are thinking he said that my face is old and tired you arethinking that i talk of power and yet i am not even able to prevent thedecay of my own body can you not understand winston that the individualis only a cell the weariness of the cell is the vigour of the organismdo you die when you cut your fingernailshe turned away from the bed and began strolling up and down again one handin his pocketwe are the priests of power he said god is power but at presentpower is only a word so far as you are concerned it is time for you togather some idea of what power means the first thing you must realizeis that power is collective the individual only has power in so far ashe ceases to be an individual you know the party slogan freedom isslavery has it ever occurred to you that it is reversible slavery isfreedom alonefreethe human being is always defeated it must be sobecause every human being is doomed to die which is the greatest of allfailures but if he can make complete utter submission if he can escapefrom his identity if he can merge himself in the party so that he is theparty then he is allpowerful and immortal the second thing for you torealize is that power is power over human beings over the bodybut aboveall over the mind power over matterexternal reality as you would callitis not important already our control over matter is absolutefor a moment winston ignored the dial he made a violent effort to raisehimself into a sitting position and merely succeeded in wrenching hisbody painfullybut how can you control matter he burst out you dont even controlthe climate or the law of gravity and there are disease pain deathobrien silenced him by a movement of his hand we control matter becausewe control the mind reality is inside the skull you will learn bydegrees winston there is nothing that we could not do invisibilitylevitationanything i could float off this floor like a soap bubble ifi wish to i do not wish to because the party does not wish it you mustget rid of those nineteenthcentury ideas about the laws of nature wemake the laws of naturebut you do not you are not even masters of this planet what abouteurasia and eastasia you have not conquered them yetunimportant we shall conquer them when it suits us and if we did notwhat difference would it make we can shut them out of existence oceaniais the worldbut the world itself is only a speck of dust and man is tinyhelplesshow long has he been in existence for millions of years the earth wasuninhabitednonsense the earth is as old as we are no older how could it be oldernothing exists except through human consciousnessbut the rocks are full of the bones of extinct animalsmammoths andmastodons and enormous reptiles which lived here long before man was everheard ofhave you ever seen those bones winston of course not nineteenthcenturybiologists invented them before man there was nothing after man if hecould come to an end there would be nothing outside man there isnothingbut the whole universe is outside us look at the stars some of them area million lightyears away they are out of our reach for everwhat are the stars said obrien indifferently they are bits of firea few kilometres away we could reach them if we wanted to or we couldblot them out the earth is the centre of the universe the sun and thestars go round itwinston made another convulsive movement this time he did not sayanything obrien continued as though answering a spoken objectionfor certain purposes of course that is not true when we navigate theocean or when we predict an eclipse we often find it convenient toassume that the earth goes round the sun and that the stars are millionsupon millions of kilometres away but what of it do you suppose it isbeyond us to produce a dual system of astronomy the stars can be nearor distant according as we need them do you suppose our mathematiciansare unequal to that have you forgotten doublethinkwinston shrank back upon the bed whatever he said the swift answercrushed him like a bludgeon and yet he knew he knew that he was in theright the belief that nothing exists outside your own mindsurely theremust be some way of demonstrating that it was false had it not beenexposed long ago as a fallacy there was even a name for it which hehad forgotten a faint smile twitched the corners of obriens mouth ashe looked down at himi told you winston he said that metaphysics is not your strongpoint the word you are trying to think of is solipsism but you aremistaken this is not solipsism collective solipsism if you like butthat is a different thing in fact the opposite thing all this is adigression he added in a different tone the real power the power wehave to fight for night and day is not power over things but over menhe paused and for a moment assumed again his air of a schoolmasterquestioning a promising pupil how does one man assert his power overanother winstonwinston thought by making him suffer he saidexactly by making him suffer obedience is not enough unless he issuffering how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not hisown power is in inflicting pain and humiliation power is in tearinghuman minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes ofyour own choosing do you begin to see then what kind of world we arecreating it is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic utopias thatthe old reformers imagined a world of fear and treachery and torment aworld of trampling and being trampled upon a world which will grow notless but more merciless as it refines itself progress in our world willbe progress towards more pain the old civilizations claimed that theywere founded on love or justice ours is founded upon hatred in our worldthere will be no emotions except fear rage triumph and selfabasementeverything else we shall destroyeverything already we are breaking downthe habits of thought which have survived from before the revolution wehave cut the links between child and parent and between man and man andbetween man and woman no one dares trust a wife or a child or a friendany longer but in the future there will be no wives and no friendschildren will be taken from their mothers at birth as one takes eggs froma hen the sex instinct will be eradicated procreation will be an annualformality like the renewal of a ration card we shall abolish the orgasmour neurologists are at work upon it now there will be no loyalty exceptloyalty towards the party there will be no love except the love ofbig brother there will be no laughter except the laugh of triumph overa defeated enemy there will be no art no literature no science whenwe are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science there will beno distinction between beauty and ugliness there will be no curiosityno enjoyment of the process of life all competing pleasures will bedestroyed but alwaysdo not forget this winstonalways there will bethe intoxication of power constantly increasing and constantly growingsubtler always at every moment there will be the thrill of victorythe sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless if you want apicture of the future imagine a boot stamping on a human facefor everhe paused as though he expected winston to speak winston had tried toshrink back into the surface of the bed again he could not say anythinghis heart seemed to be frozen obrien went onand remember that it is for ever the face will always be there to bestamped upon the heretic the enemy of society will always be there sothat he can be defeated and humiliated over again everything that youhave undergone since you have been in our handsall that will continueand worse the espionage the betrayals the arrests the tortures theexecutions the disappearances will never cease it will be a world ofterror as much as a world of triumph the more the party is powerful theless it will be tolerant the weaker the opposition the tighter thedespotism goldstein and his heresies will live for ever every day atevery moment they will be defeated discredited ridiculed spat upon andyet they will always survive this drama that i have played out with youduring seven years will be played out over and over again generation aftergeneration always in subtler forms always we shall have the heretic hereat our mercy screaming with pain broken up contemptibleand in the endutterly penitent saved from himself crawling to our feet of his ownaccord that is the world that we are preparing winston a world ofvictory after victory triumph after triumph after triumph an endlesspressing pressing pressing upon the nerve of power you are beginningi can see to realize what that world will be like but in the end youwill do more than understand it you will accept it welcome it becomepart of itwinston had recovered himself sufficiently to speak you cant he saidweaklywhat do you mean by that remark winstonyou could not create such a world as you have just described it is adream it is impossiblewhyit is impossible to found a civilization on fear and hatred and crueltyit would never endurewhy notit would have no vitality it would disintegrate it would commitsuicidenonsense you are under the impression that hatred is more exhaustingthan love why should it be and if it were what difference would thatmake suppose that we choose to wear ourselves out faster suppose that wequicken the tempo of human life till men are senile at thirty still whatdifference would it make can you not understand that the death of theindividual is not death the party is immortalas usual the voice had battered winston into helplessness moreover hewas in dread that if he persisted in his disagreement obrien would twistthe dial again and yet he could not keep silent feebly withoutarguments with nothing to support him except his inarticulate horror ofwhat obrien had said he returned to the attacki dont knowi dont care somehow you will fail something will defeatyou life will defeat youwe control life winston at all its levels you are imagining that thereis something called human nature which will be outraged by what we do andwill turn against us but we create human nature men are infinitelymalleable or perhaps you have returned to your old idea that theproletarians or the slaves will arise and overthrow us put it out of yourmind they are helpless like the animals humanity is the party theothers are outsideirrelevanti dont care in the end they will beat you sooner or later they willsee you for what you are and then they will tear you to piecesdo you see any evidence that that is happening or any reason why itshouldno i believe it i know that you will fail there is something in theuniversei dont know some spirit some principlethat you will neverovercomedo you believe in god winstonnothen what is it this principle that will defeat usi dont know the spirit of manand do you consider yourself a manyesif you are a man winston you are the last man your kind is extinct weare the inheritors do you understand that you are alone you are outsidehistory you are nonexistent his manner changed and he said moreharshly and you consider yourself morally superior to us with our liesand our crueltyyes i consider myself superiorobrien did not speak two other voices were speaking after a momentwinston recognized one of them as his own it was a soundtrack of theconversation he had had with obrien on the night when he had enrolledhimself in the brotherhood he heard himself promising to lie to stealto forge to murder to encourage drugtaking and prostitution todisseminate venereal diseases to throw vitriol in a childs face obrienmade a small impatient gesture as though to say that the demonstrationwas hardly worth making then he turned a switch and the voices stoppedget up from that bed he saidthe bonds had loosened themselves winston lowered himself to the floorand stood up unsteadilyyou are the last man said obrien you are the guardian of the humanspirit you shall see yourself as you are take off your clotheswinston undid the bit of string that held his overalls together the zipfastener had long since been wrenched out of them he could not rememberwhether at any time since his arrest he had taken off all his clothes atone time beneath the overalls his body was looped with filthy yellowishrags just recognizable as the remnants of underclothes as he slidthem to the ground he saw that there was a threesided mirror at the farend of the room he approached it then stopped short an involuntary cryhad broken out of himgo on said obrien stand between the wings of the mirror you shallsee the side view as wellhe had stopped because he was frightened a bowed greycolouredskeletonlike thing was coming towards him its actual appearance wasfrightening and not merely the fact that he knew it to be himself hemoved closer to the glass the creatures face seemed to be protrudedbecause of its bent carriage a forlorn jailbirds face with a nobbyforehead running back into a bald scalp a crooked nose andbatteredlooking cheekbones above which his eyes were fierce and watchfulthe cheeks were seamed the mouth had a drawnin look certainly it washis own face but it seemed to him that it had changed more than he hadchanged inside the emotions it registered would be different from theones he felt he had gone partially bald for the first moment he hadthought that he had gone grey as well but it was only the scalp that wasgrey except for his hands and a circle of his face his body was grey allover with ancient ingrained dirt here and there under the dirt therewere the red scars of wounds and near the ankle the varicose ulcer was aninflamed mass with flakes of skin peeling off it but the truly frighteningthing was the emaciation of his body the barrel of the ribs was as narrowas that of a skeleton the legs had shrunk so that the knees were thickerthan the thighs he saw now what obrien had meant about seeing the sideview the curvature of the spine was astonishing the thin shoulders werehunched forward so as to make a cavity of the chest the scraggy neckseemed to be bending double under the weight of the skull at a guess hewould have said that it was the body of a man of sixty suffering fromsome malignant diseaseyou have thought sometimes said obrien that my facethe face of amember of the inner partylooks old and worn what do you think of yourown facehe seized winstons shoulder and spun him round so that he was facing himlook at the condition you are in he said look at this filthy grimeall over your body look at the dirt between your toes look at thatdisgusting running sore on your leg do you know that you stink like agoat probably you have ceased to notice it look at your emaciation doyou see i can make my thumb and forefinger meet round your bicep i couldsnap your neck like a carrot do you know that you have lost twentyfivekilograms since you have been in our hands even your hair is coming outin handfuls look he plucked at winstons head and brought away a tuftof hair open your mouth nine ten eleven teeth left how many had youwhen you came to us and the few you have left are dropping out of yourhead look herehe seized one of winstons remaining front teeth between his powerfulthumb and forefinger a twinge of pain shot through winstons jaw obrienhad wrenched the loose tooth out by the roots he tossed it across thecellyou are rotting away he said you are falling to pieces what are youa bag of filth now turn around and look into that mirror again do yousee that thing facing you that is the last man if you are human that ishumanity now put your clothes on againwinston began to dress himself with slow stiff movements until now he hadnot seemed to notice how thin and weak he was only one thought stirred inhis mind that he must have been in this place longer than he had imaginedthen suddenly as he fixed the miserable rags round himself a feeling ofpity for his ruined body overcame him before he knew what he was doinghe had collapsed on to a small stool that stood beside the bed and burstinto tears he was aware of his ugliness his gracelessness a bundle ofbones in filthy underclothes sitting weeping in the harsh white light buthe could not stop himself obrien laid a hand on his shoulder almostkindlyit will not last for ever he said you can escape from it whenever youchoose everything depends on yourselfyou did it sobbed winston you reduced me to this stateno winston you reduced yourself to it this is what you accepted whenyou set yourself up against the party it was all contained in that firstact nothing has happened that you did not foreseehe paused and then went onwe have beaten you winston we have broken you up you have seen whatyour body is like your mind is in the same state i do not think therecan be much pride left in you you have been kicked and flogged andinsulted you have screamed with pain you have rolled on the floor inyour own blood and vomit you have whimpered for mercy you have betrayedeverybody and everything can you think of a single degradation that hasnot happened to youwinston had stopped weeping though the tears were still oozing out of hiseyes he looked up at obrieni have not betrayed julia he saidobrien looked down at him thoughtfully no he said no that isperfectly true you have not betrayed juliathe peculiar reverence for obrien which nothing seemed able to destroyflooded winstons heart again how intelligent he thought howintelligent never did obrien fail to understand what was said to himanyone else on earth would have answered promptly that he had betrayedjulia for what was there that they had not screwed out of him under thetorture he had told them everything he knew about her her habits hercharacter her past life he had confessed in the most trivial detaileverything that had happened at their meetings all that he had said toher and she to him their blackmarket meals their adulteries theirvague plottings against the partyeverything and yet in the sense inwhich he intended the word he had not betrayed her he had not stoppedloving her his feelings towards her had remained the same obrien hadseen what he meant without the need for explanationtell me he said how soon will they shoot meit might be a long time said obrien you are a difficult case butdont give up hope everyone is cured sooner or later in the end we shallshoot youchapter he was much better he was growing fatter and stronger every day if itwas proper to speak of daysthe white light and the humming sound were the same as ever but the cellwas a little more comfortable than the others he had been in there was apillow and a mattress on the plank bed and a stool to sit on they hadgiven him a bath and they allowed him to wash himself fairly frequentlyin a tin basin they even gave him warm water to wash with they had givenhim new underclothes and a clean suit of overalls they had dressed hisvaricose ulcer with soothing ointment they had pulled out the remnantsof his teeth and given him a new set of denturesweeks or months must have passed it would have been possible now to keepcount of the passage of time if he had felt any interest in doing sosince he was being fed at what appeared to be regular intervals he wasgetting he judged three meals in the twentyfour hours sometimes hewondered dimly whether he was getting them by night or by day the foodwas surprisingly good with meat at every third meal once there was evena packet of cigarettes he had no matches but the neverspeaking guardwho brought his food would give him a light the first time he tried tosmoke it made him sick but he persevered and spun the packet out fora long time smoking half a cigarette after each mealthey had given him a white slate with a stump of pencil tied to thecorner at first he made no use of it even when he was awake he wascompletely torpid often he would lie from one meal to the next almostwithout stirring sometimes asleep sometimes waking into vague reveriesin which it was too much trouble to open his eyes he had long grownused to sleeping with a strong light on his face it seemed to make nodifference except that ones dreams were more coherent he dreamed agreat deal all through this time and they were always happy dreams hewas in the golden country or he was sitting among enormous glorioussunlit ruins with his mother with julia with obriennot doinganything merely sitting in the sun talking of peaceful things suchthoughts as he had when he was awake were mostly about his dreams heseemed to have lost the power of intellectual effort now that thestimulus of pain had been removed he was not bored he had no desirefor conversation or distraction merely to be alone not to be beatenor questioned to have enough to eat and to be clean all over wascompletely satisfyingby degrees he came to spend less time in sleep but he still felt noimpulse to get off the bed all he cared for was to lie quiet and feel thestrength gathering in his body he would finger himself here and theretrying to make sure that it was not an illusion that his muscles weregrowing rounder and his skin tauter finally it was established beyond adoubt that he was growing fatter his thighs were now definitely thickerthan his knees after that reluctantly at first he began exercisinghimself regularly in a little while he could walk three kilometresmeasured by pacing the cell and his bowed shoulders were growingstraighter he attempted more elaborate exercises and was astonished andhumiliated to find what things he could not do he could not move out of awalk he could not hold his stool out at arms length he could not standon one leg without falling over he squatted down on his heels and foundthat with agonizing pains in thigh and calf he could just lift himself toa standing position he lay flat on his belly and tried to lift his weightby his hands it was hopeless he could not raise himself a centimetrebut after a few more daysa few more mealtimeseven that feat wasaccomplished a time came when he could do it six times running he beganto grow actually proud of his body and to cherish an intermittent beliefthat his face also was growing back to normal only when he chanced to puthis hand on his bald scalp did he remember the seamed ruined face thathad looked back at him out of the mirrorhis mind grew more active he sat down on the plank bed his back againstthe wall and the slate on his knees and set to work deliberately at thetask of reeducating himselfhe had capitulated that was agreed in reality as he saw now he hadbeen ready to capitulate long before he had taken the decision from themoment when he was inside the ministry of loveand yes even during thoseminutes when he and julia had stood helpless while the iron voice from thetelescreen told them what to dohe had grasped the frivolity theshallowness of his attempt to set himself up against the power of theparty he knew now that for seven years the thought police had watched himlike a beetle under a magnifying glass there was no physical act no wordspoken aloud that they had not noticed no train of thought that they hadnot been able to infer even the speck of whitish dust on the cover of hisdiary they had carefully replaced they had played soundtracks to himshown him photographs some of them were photographs of julia and himselfyes even he could not fight against the party any longer besidesthe party was in the right it must be so how could the immortalcollective brain be mistaken by what external standard could you checkits judgements sanity was statistical it was merely a question oflearning to think as they thought onlythe pencil felt thick and awkward in his fingers he began to write downthe thoughts that came into his head he wrote first in large clumsycapitalsfreedom is slaverythen almost without a pause he wrote beneath ittwo and two make fivebut then there came a sort of check his mind as though shying away fromsomething seemed unable to concentrate he knew that he knew what camenext but for the moment he could not recall it when he did recall itit was only by consciously reasoning out what it must be it did not comeof its own accord he wrotegod is powerhe accepted everything the past was alterable the past never had beenaltered oceania was at war with eastasia oceania had always been at warwith eastasia jones aaronson and rutherford were guilty of the crimesthey were charged with he had never seen the photograph that disprovedtheir guilt it had never existed he had invented it he rememberedremembering contrary things but those were false memories products ofselfdeception how easy it all was only surrender and everything elsefollowed it was like swimming against a current that swept you backwardshowever hard you struggled and then suddenly deciding to turn round andgo with the current instead of opposing it nothing had changed exceptyour own attitude the predestined thing happened in any case he hardlyknew why he had ever rebelled everything was easy exceptanything could be true the socalled laws of nature were nonsense thelaw of gravity was nonsense if i wished obrien had said i couldfloat off this floor like a soap bubble winston worked it out if hethinks he floats off the floor and if i simultaneously think i see himdo it then the thing happens suddenly like a lump of submerged wreckagebreaking the surface of water the thought burst into his mind it doesntreally happen we imagine it it is hallucination he pushed the thoughtunder instantly the fallacy was obvious it presupposed that somewhereor other outside oneself there was a real world where real thingshappened but how could there be such a world what knowledge have we ofanything save through our own minds all happenings are in the mindwhatever happens in all minds truly happenshe had no difficulty in disposing of the fallacy and he was in no dangerof succumbing to it he realized nevertheless that it ought never tohave occurred to him the mind should develop a blind spot whenever adangerous thought presented itself the process should be automaticinstinctive crimestop they called it in newspeakhe set to work to exercise himself in crimestop he presented himself withpropositionsthe party says the earth is flat the party says thatice is heavier than waterand trained himself in not seeing or notunderstanding the arguments that contradicted them it was not easyit needed great powers of reasoning and improvisation the arithmeticalproblems raised for instance by such a statement as two and two makefive were beyond his intellectual grasp it needed also a sort ofathleticism of mind an ability at one moment to make the most delicateuse of logic and at the next to be unconscious of the crudest logicalerrors stupidity was as necessary as intelligence and as difficult toattainall the while with one part of his mind he wondered how soon they wouldshoot him everything depends on yourself obrien had said but he knewthat there was no conscious act by which he could bring it nearer itmight be ten minutes hence or ten years they might keep him for years insolitary confinement they might send him to a labourcamp they mightrelease him for a while as they sometimes did it was perfectly possiblethat before he was shot the whole drama of his arrest and interrogationwould be enacted all over again the one certain thing was that deathnever came at an expected moment the traditionthe unspoken traditionsomehow you knew it though you never heard it saidwas that they shotyou from behind always in the back of the head without warning as youwalked down a corridor from cell to cellone daybut one day was not the right expression just as probably itwas in the middle of the night oncehe fell into a strange blissfulreverie he was walking down the corridor waiting for the bullet he knewthat it was coming in another moment everything was settled smoothedout reconciled there were no more doubts no more arguments no morepain no more fear his body was healthy and strong he walked easilywith a joy of movement and with a feeling of walking in sunlight he wasnot any longer in the narrow white corridors in the ministry of love hewas in the enormous sunlit passage a kilometre wide down which he hadseemed to walk in the delirium induced by drugs he was in the goldencountry following the foottrack across the old rabbitcropped pasturehe could feel the short springy turf under his feet and the gentle sunshineon his face at the edge of the field were the elm trees faintly stirringand somewhere beyond that was the stream where the dace lay in the greenpools under the willowssuddenly he started up with a shock of horror the sweat broke out on hisbackbone he had heard himself cry aloudjulia julia julia my love juliafor a moment he had had an overwhelming hallucination of her presence shehad seemed to be not merely with him but inside him it was as though shehad got into the texture of his skin in that moment he had loved her farmore than he had ever done when they were together and free also he knewthat somewhere or other she was still alive and needed his helphe lay back on the bed and tried to compose himself what had he done howmany years had he added to his servitude by that moment of weaknessin another moment he would hear the tramp of boots outside they could notlet such an outburst go unpunished they would know now if they had notknown before that he was breaking the agreement he had made with themhe obeyed the party but he still hated the party in the old days he hadhidden a heretical mind beneath an appearance of conformity now he hadretreated a step further in the mind he had surrendered but he had hopedto keep the inner heart inviolate he knew that he was in the wrong buthe preferred to be in the wrong they would understand thatobrien wouldunderstand it it was all confessed in that single foolish cryhe would have to start all over again it might take years he ran a handover his face trying to familiarize himself with the new shape therewere deep furrows in the cheeks the cheekbones felt sharp the noseflattened besides since last seeing himself in the glass he had beengiven a complete new set of teeth it was not easy to preserveinscrutability when you did not know what your face looked like in anycase mere control of the features was not enough for the first time heperceived that if you want to keep a secret you must also hide it fromyourself you must know all the while that it is there but until it isneeded you must never let it emerge into your consciousness in any shapethat could be given a name from now onwards he must not only think righthe must feel right dream right and all the while he must keep his hatredlocked up inside him like a ball of matter which was part of himself andyet unconnected with the rest of him a kind of cystone day they would decide to shoot him you could not tell when it wouldhappen but a few seconds beforehand it should be possible to guess itwas always from behind walking down a corridor ten seconds would beenough in that time the world inside him could turn over and thensuddenly without a word uttered without a check in his step without thechanging of a line in his facesuddenly the camouflage would be down andbang would go the batteries of his hatred hatred would fill him like anenormous roaring flame and almost in the same instant bang would go thebullet too late or too early they would have blown his brain to

was the most horriblesickening thing of all he thought of big brother the enormous facebecause of constantly seeing it on posters he always thought of it asbeing a metre wide with its heavy black moustache and the eyes thatfollowed you to and fro seemed to float into his mind of its own accordwhat were his true feelings towards big brotherthere was a heavy tramp of boots in the passage the steel door swung openwith a clang obrien walked into the cell behind him were the waxenfacedofficer and the blackuniformed guardsget up said obrien come herewinston stood opposite him obrien took winstons shoulders between hisstrong hands and looked at him closelyyou have had thoughts of deceiving me he said that was stupidstand up straighter look me in the facehe paused and went on in a

always able to detecta lietell me what are your true feelings towards big brotheri hate himyou hate him good then the time has come for you to take the last stepyou must love big brother it is not enough to obey him you must lovehimhe released winston with a little push towards the guardsroom  he saidchapter at each stage of his imprisonment he had known or seemed to knowwhereabouts he was in the windowless building possibly there were slightdifferences in the air pressure the cells where the guards had beaten himwere below ground level the room where he had been interrogated byobrien was high up near the roof this place was many metres undergroundas deep down as it was possible to goit was bigger than most of the cells he had been in but he hardly noticedhis surroundings all he noticed was that there were two small tablesstraight in front of him each covered with green baize one was only ametre or two from him the other was further away near the door he wasstrapped upright in a chair so tightly that he could move nothing noteven his head a sort of pad gripped his head from behind forcing him tolook straight in front of himfor a moment he was alone then the door opened and obrien came inyou asked me once said obrien what was in room  i told you thatyou knew the answer already everyone knows it the thing that is inroom  is the worst thing in the worldthe door opened again a guard came in carrying something made of wirea box or basket of some kind he set it down on the further table becauseof the position in which obrien was standing winston could not see whatthe thing wasthe worst thing in the world said obrien varies from individual toindividual it may be burial alive or death by fire or by drowning orby impalement or fifty other deaths there are cases where it is somequite trivial thing not even fatalhe had moved a little to one side so that winston had a better view ofthe thing on the table it was an oblong wire cage with a handle on topfor carrying it by fixed to the front of it was something that lookedlike a fencing mask with the concave side outwards although it was threeor four metres away from him he could see that the cage was dividedlengthways into two compartments and that there was some kind of creaturein each they were ratsin your case said obrien the worst thing in the world happens to beratsa sort of premonitory tremor a fear of he was not certain what hadpassed through winston as soon as he caught his first glimpse of the cagebut at this moment the meaning of the masklike attachment in front of itsuddenly sank into him his bowels seemed to turn to wateryou cant do that he cried out in a high cracked voice you couldntyou couldnt its impossibledo you remember said obrien the moment of panic that used to occurin your dreams there was a wall of blackness in front of you and aroaring sound in your ears there was something terrible on the other sideof the wall you knew that you knew what it was but you dared not drag itinto the open it was the rats that were on the other side of the wallobrien said winston making an effort to control his voice you knowthis is not necessary what is it that you want me to doobrien made no direct answer when he spoke it was in the schoolmasterishmanner that he sometimes affected he looked thoughtfully into thedistance as though he were addressing an audience somewhere behindwinstons backby itself he said pain is not always enough there are occasions whena human being will stand out against pain even to the point of deathbut for everyone there is something unendurablesomething that cannot becontemplated courage and cowardice are not involved if you are fallingfrom a height it is not cowardly to clutch at a rope if you have come upfrom deep water it is not cowardly to fill your lungs with air it ismerely an instinct which cannot be destroyed it is the same with therats for you they are unendurable they are a form of pressure that youcannot withstand even if you wished to you will do what is required ofyoubut what is it what is it how can i do it if i dont know what it isobrien picked up the cage and brought it across to the nearer tablehe set it down carefully on the baize cloth winston could hear the bloodsinging in his ears he had the feeling of sitting in utter lonelinesshe was in the middle of a great empty plain a flat desert drenched withsunlight across which all sounds came to him out of immense distancesyet the cage with the rats was not two metres away from him they wereenormous rats they were at the age when a rats muzzle grows blunt andfierce and his fur brown instead of greythe rat said obrien still addressing his invisible audiencealthough a rodent is carnivorous you are aware of that you will haveheard of the things that happen in the poor quarters of this town in somestreets a woman dare not leave her baby alone in the house even for fiveminutes the rats are certain to attack it within quite a small time theywill strip it to the bones they also attack sick or dying people theyshow astonishing intelligence in knowing when a human being is helplessthere was an outburst of squeals from the cage it seemed to reach winstonfrom far away the rats were fighting they were trying to get at eachother through the partition he heard also a deep groan of despairthat too seemed to come from outside himselfobrien picked up the cage and as he did so pressed something in itthere was a sharp click winston made a frantic effort to tear himselfloose from the chair it was hopeless every part of him even his headwas held immovably obrien moved the cage nearer it was less than ametre from winstons facei have pressed the first lever said obrien you understand theconstruction of this cage the mask will fit over your head leaving noexit when i press this other lever the door of the cage will slide upthese starving brutes will shoot out of it like bullets have you everseen a rat leap through the air they will leap on to your face and borestraight into it sometimes they attack the eyes first sometimes theyburrow through the cheeks and devour the tonguethe cage was nearer it was closing in winston heard a succession ofshrill cries which appeared to be occurring in the air above his head buthe fought furiously against his panic to think to think even with asplit second leftto think was the only hope suddenly the foul mustyodour of the brutes struck his nostrils there was a violent convulsion ofnausea inside him and he almost lost consciousness everything had goneblack for an instant he was insane a screaming animal yet he came outof the blackness clutching an idea there was one and only one way to savehimself he must interpose another human being the body of another humanbeing between himself and the ratsthe circle of the mask was large enough now to shut out the vision ofanything else the wire door was a couple of handspans from his face therats knew what was coming now one of them was leaping up and down theother an old scaly grandfather of the sewers stood up with his pinkhands against the bars and fiercely sniffed the air winston could seethe whiskers and the yellow teeth again the black panic took hold of himhe was blind helpless mindlessit was a common punishment in imperial china said obrien asdidactically as everthe mask was closing on his face the wire brushed his cheek and thennoit was not relief only hope a tiny fragment of hope too late perhapstoo late but he had suddenly understood that in the whole world there wasjust one person to whom he could transfer his punishmentone body that hecould thrust between himself and the rats and he was shouting franticallyover and overdo it to julia do it to julia not me julia i dont care what you doto her tear her face off strip her to the bones not me julia not mehe was falling backwards into enormous depths away from the rats he wasstill strapped in the chair but he had fallen through the floor throughthe walls of the building through the earth through the oceans throughthe atmosphere into outer space into the gulfs between the starsalwaysaway away away from the rats he was light years distant but obrienwas still standing at his side there was still the cold touch of wireagainst his cheek but through the darkness that enveloped him he heardanother metallic click and knew that the cage door had clicked shut andnot openchapter the chestnut tree was almost empty a ray of sunlight slanting through awindow fell on dusty tabletops it was the lonely hour of fifteen atinny music trickled from the telescreenswinston sat in his usual corner gazing into an empty glass now and againhe glanced up at a vast face which eyed him from the opposite wallbig brother is watching you the caption said unbidden a waiter came andfilled his glass up with victory gin shaking into it a few drops fromanother bottle with a quill through the cork it was saccharine flavouredwith cloves the speciality of the cafewinston was listening to the telescreen at present only music was comingout of it but there was a possibility that at any moment there might bea special bulletin from the ministry of peace the news from the africanfront was disquieting in the extreme on and off he had been worryingabout it all day a eurasian army oceania was at war with eurasiaoceania had always been at war with eurasia was moving southward atterrifying speed the midday bulletin had not mentioned any definitearea but it was probable that already the mouth of the congo was abattlefield brazzaville and leopoldville were in danger one did not haveto look at the map to see what it meant it was not merely a question oflosing central africa for the first time in the whole war the territoryof oceania itself was menaceda violent emotion not fear exactly but a sort of undifferentiatedexcitement flared up in him then faded again he stopped thinking aboutthe war in these days he could never fix his mind on any one subject formore than a few moments at a time he picked up his glass and drained itat a gulp as always the gin made him shudder and even retch slightlythe stuff was horrible the cloves and saccharine themselves disgustingenough in their sickly way could not disguise the flat oily smell andwhat was worst of all was that the smell of gin which dwelt with himnight and day was inextricably mixed up in his mind with the smell ofthosehe never named them even in his thoughts and so far as it was possiblehe never visualized them they were something that he was halfaware ofhovering close to his face a smell that clung to his nostrils as the ginrose in him he belched through purple lips he had grown fatter since theyreleased him and had regained his old colourindeed more than regainedit his features had thickened the skin on nose and cheekbones wascoarsely red even the bald scalp was too deep a pink a waiter againunbidden brought the chessboard and the current issue of the timeswith the page turned down at the chess problem then seeing that winstonsglass was empty he brought the gin bottle and filled it there was noneed to give orders they knew his habits the chessboard was alwayswaiting for him his corner table was always reserved even when the placewas full he had it to himself since nobody cared to be seen sitting tooclose to him he never even bothered to count his drinks at irregularintervals they presented him with a dirty slip of paper which they saidwas the bill but he had the impression that they always undercharged himit would have made no difference if it had been the other way about hehad always plenty of money nowadays he even had a job a sinecure morehighlypaid than his old job had beenthe music from the telescreen stopped and a voice took over winston raisedhis head to listen no bulletins from the front however it was merely abrief announcement from the ministry of plenty in the preceding quarterit appeared the tenth threeyear plans quota for bootlaces had beenoverfulfilled by  per centhe examined the chess problem and set out the pieces it was a trickyending involving a couple of knights white to play and mate in twomoves winston looked up at the portrait of big brother white alwaysmates he thought with a sort of cloudy mysticism always withoutexception it is so arranged in no chess problem since the beginning ofthe world has black ever won did it not symbolize the eternal unvaryingtriumph of good over evil the huge face gazed back at him full of calmpower white always matesthe voice from the telescreen paused and added in a different and muchgraver tone you are warned to stand by for an important announcement atfifteenthirty fifteenthirty this is news of the highest importancetake care not to miss it fifteenthirty the tinkling music struck upagainwinstons heart stirred that was the bulletin from the front instincttold him that it was bad news that was coming all day with little spurtsof excitement the thought of a smashing defeat in africa had been in andout of his mind he seemed actually to see the eurasian army swarmingacross the neverbroken frontier and pouring down into the tip of africalike a column of ants why had it not been possible to outflank them insome way the outline of the west african coast stood out vividly in hismind he picked up the white knight and moved it across the board therewas the proper spot even while he saw the black horde racing southward hesaw another force mysteriously assembled suddenly planted in their rearcutting their communications by land and sea he felt that by willing it hewas bringing that other force into existence but it was necessary to actquickly if they could get control of the whole of africa if they hadairfields and submarine bases at the cape it would cut oceania in two itmight mean anything defeat breakdown the redivision of the world thedestruction of the party he drew a deep breath an extraordinary medleyof feelingbut it was not a medley exactly rather it was successivelayers of feeling in which one could not say which layer wasundermoststruggled inside himthe spasm passed he put the white knight back in its place but for themoment he could not settle down to serious study of the chess problemhis thoughts wandered again almost unconsciously he traced with hisfinger in the dust on the tablethey cant get inside you she had said but they could get inside youwhat happens to you here is for ever obrien had said that was a trueword there were things your own acts from which you could never recoversomething was killed in your breast burnt out cauterized outhe had seen her he had even spoken to her there was no danger in it heknew as though instinctively that they now took almost no interest in hisdoings he could have arranged to meet her a second time if either of themhad wanted to actually it was by chance that they had met it was in thepark on a vile biting day in march when the earth was like iron andall the grass seemed dead and there was not a bud anywhere except a fewcrocuses which had pushed themselves up to be dismembered by the wind hewas hurrying along with frozen hands and watering eyes when he saw her notten metres away from him it struck him at once that she had changed insome illdefined way they almost passed one another without a sign thenhe turned and followed her not very eagerly he knew that there was nodanger nobody would take any interest in him she did not speak shewalked obliquely away across the grass as though trying to get rid of himthen seemed to resign herself to having him at her side presently theywere in among a clump of ragged leafless shrubs useless either forconcealment or as protection from the wind they halted it was vilelycold the wind whistled through the twigs and fretted the occasionaldirtylooking crocuses he put his arm round her waistthere was no telescreen but there must be hidden microphones besidesthey could be seen it did not matter nothing mattered they could havelain down on the ground and done that if they had wanted to his fleshfroze with horror at the thought of it she made no response whatever tothe clasp of his arm she did not even try to disengage herself he knewnow what had changed in her her face was sallower and there was a longscar partly hidden by the hair across her forehead and temple but thatwas not the change it was that her waist had grown thicker and in asurprising way had stiffened he remembered how once after the explosionof a rocket bomb he had helped to drag a corpse out of some ruins andhad been astonished not only by the incredible weight of the thing but byits rigidity and awkwardness to handle which made it seem more like stonethan flesh her body felt like that it occurred to him that the textureof her skin would be quite different from what it had once beenhe did not attempt to kiss her nor did they speak as they walked backacross the grass she looked directly at him for the first time itwas only a momentary glance full of contempt and dislike he wonderedwhether it was a dislike that came purely out of the past or whether itwas inspired also by his bloated face and the water that the wind keptsqueezing from his eyes they sat down on two iron chairs side by sidebut not too close together he saw that she was about to speak she movedher clumsy shoe a few centimetres and deliberately crushed a twig herfeet seemed to have grown broader he noticedi betrayed you she said baldlyi betrayed you he saidshe gave him another quick look of dislikesometimes she said they threaten you with something something youcant stand up to cant even think about and then you say dont do itto me do it to somebody else do it to soandso and perhaps you mightpretend afterwards that it was only a trick and that you just said it tomake them stop and didnt really mean it but that isnt true at the timewhen it happens you do mean it you think theres no other way of savingyourself and youre quite ready to save yourself that way you want it tohappen to the other person you dont give a damn what they suffer allyou care about is yourselfall you care about is yourself he echoedand after that you dont feel the same towards the other person anylongerno he said you dont feel the samethere did not seem to be anything more to say the wind plastered theirthin overalls against their bodies almost at once it became embarrassingto sit there in silence besides it was too cold to keep still she saidsomething about catching her tube and stood up to gowe must meet again he saidyes she said we must meet againhe followed irresolutely for a little distance half a pace behind herthey did not speak again she did not actually try to shake him off butwalked at just such a speed as to prevent his keeping abreast of herhe had made up his mind that he would accompany her as far as the tubestation but suddenly this process of trailing along in the cold seemedpointless and unbearable he was overwhelmed by a desire not so much toget away from julia as to get back to the chestnut tree cafe which hadnever seemed so attractive as at this moment he had a nostalgic visionof his corner table with the newspaper and the chessboard and theeverflowing gin above all it would be warm in there the next momentnot altogether by accident he allowed himself to become separated fromher by a small knot of people he made a halfhearted attempt to catch upthen slowed down turned and made off in the opposite direction when hehad gone fifty metres he looked back the street was not crowded butalready he could not distinguish her any one of a dozen hurrying figuresmight have been hers perhaps her thickened stiffened body was no longerrecognizable from behindat the time when it happens she had said you do mean it he hadmeant it he had not merely said it he had wished it he had wished thatshe and not he should be delivered over to thesomething changed in the music that trickled from the telescreen acracked and jeering note a yellow note came into it and thenperhapsit was not happening perhaps it was only a memory taking on the semblanceof sounda voice was singing  under the spreading chestnut tree  i sold you and you sold methe tears welled up in his eyes a passing waiter noticed that his glasswas empty and came back with the gin bottlehe took up his glass and sniffed at it the stuff grew not less but morehorrible with every mouthful he drank but it had become the element heswam in it was his life his death and his resurrection it was gin thatsank him into stupor every night and gin that revived him every morningwhen he woke seldom before eleven hundred with gummedup eyelids andfiery mouth and a back that seemed to be broken it would have beenimpossible even to rise from the horizontal if it had not been for thebottle and teacup placed beside the bed overnight through the middayhours he sat with glazed face the bottle handy listening to thetelescreen from fifteen to closingtime he was a fixture in the chestnuttree no one cared what he did any longer no whistle woke him notelescreen admonished him occasionally perhaps twice a week he wentto a dusty forgottenlooking office in the ministry of truth and dida little work or what was called work he had been appointed to asubcommittee of a subcommittee which had sprouted from one of theinnumerable committees dealing with minor difficulties that arose in thecompilation of the eleventh edition of the newspeak dictionary they wereengaged in producing something called an interim report but what it wasthat they were reporting on he had never definitely found out it wassomething to do with the question of whether commas should be placedinside brackets or outside there were four others on the committee allof them persons similar to himself there were days when they assembledand then promptly dispersed again frankly admitting to one another thatthere was not really anything to be done but there were other days whenthey settled down to their work almost eagerly making a tremendous showof entering up their minutes and drafting long memoranda which were neverfinishedwhen the argument as to what they were supposedly arguing aboutgrew extraordinarily involved and abstruse with subtle haggling overdefinitions enormous digressions quarrelsthreats even to appeal tohigher authority and then suddenly the life would go out of them andthey would sit round the table looking at one another with extinct eyeslike ghosts fading at cockcrowthe telescreen was silent for a moment winston raised his head again thebulletin but no they were merely changing the music he had the map ofafrica behind his eyelids the movement of the armies was a diagram ablack arrow tearing vertically southward and a white arrow horizontallyeastward across the tail of the first as though for reassurance helooked up at the imperturbable face in the portrait was it conceivablethat the second arrow did not even existhis interest flagged again he drank another mouthful of gin picked upthe white knight and made a tentative move check but it was evidentlynot the right move becauseuncalled a memory floated into his mind he saw a candlelit room with avast whitecounterpaned bed and himself a boy of nine or ten sitting onthe floor shaking a dicebox and laughing excitedly his mother wassitting opposite him and also laughingit must have been about a month before she disappeared it was a moment ofreconciliation when the nagging hunger in his belly was forgotten and hisearlier affection for her had temporarily revived he remembered the daywell a pelting drenching day when the water streamed down the windowpaneand the light indoors was too dull to read by the boredom of the twochildren in the dark cramped bedroom became unbearable winston whinedand grizzled made futile demands for food fretted about the room pullingeverything out of place and kicking the wainscoting until the neighboursbanged on the wall while the younger child wailed intermittently in theend his mother said now be good and ill buy you a toy a lovelytoyyoull love it and then she had gone out in the rain to a littlegeneral shop which was still sporadically open nearby and came back witha cardboard box containing an outfit of snakes and ladders he could stillremember the smell of the damp cardboard it was a miserable outfit theboard was cracked and the tiny wooden dice were so illcut that theywould hardly lie on their sides winston looked at the thing sulkily andwithout interest but then his mother lit a piece of candle and they satdown on the floor to play soon he was wildly excited and shouting withlaughter as the tiddlywinks climbed hopefully up the ladders and thencame slithering down the snakes again almost to the startingpoint theyplayed eight games winning four each his tiny sister too young tounderstand what the game was about had sat propped up against a bolsterlaughing because the others were laughing for a whole afternoon they hadall been happy together as in his earlier childhoodhe pushed the picture out of his mind it was a false memory he wastroubled by false memories occasionally they did not matter so long asone knew them for what they were some things had happened others had nothappened he turned back to the chessboard and picked up the white knightagain almost in the same instant it dropped on to the board with aclatter he had started as though a pin had run into hima shrill trumpetcall had pierced the air it was the bulletin victoryit always meant victory when a trumpetcall preceded the news a sort ofelectric drill ran through the cafe even the waiters had started andpricked up their earsthe trumpetcall had let loose an enormous volume of noise already anexcited voice was gabbling from the telescreen but even as it startedit was almost drowned by a roar of cheering from outside the news hadrun round the streets like magic he could hear just enough of what wasissuing from the telescreen to realize that it had all happened as he hadforeseen a vast seaborne armada had secretly assembled a sudden blow inthe enemys rear the white arrow tearing across the

whole of africabringthe war within measurable distance of its endvictorygreatest victoryin human historyvictory victory victoryunder the table winstons feet made convulsive movements he had notstirred from his seat but in his mind he was running swiftly runninghe was with the crowds outside cheering himself deaf he looked up againat the portrait of big brother the colossus that bestrode the worldthe rock against which the hordes of asia dashed themselves in vain hethought how ten minutes agoyes only ten minutesthere had still beenequivocation in his heart as he wondered whether the news from the frontwould be of victory or defeat ah it was more than a eurasian army thathad perished much had changed in him since that first day in the ministryof love but the final indispensable healing change had never happeneduntil this momentthe voice from the telescreen was still pouring forth its tale of prisonersand booty and slaughter but the shouting outside had died down a littlethe waiters were turning back to their work one of them approached withthe gin bottle winston sitting in a blissful dream paid no attentionas his glass was filled up he was not running or cheering any longer hewas back in the ministry of love with everything forgiven his soul whiteas snow he was in the public dock confessing everything implicatingeverybody he was walking down the whitetiled corridor with the feelingof walking in sunlight and an armed guard at his back the longhopedforbullet was entering his brainhe gazed up at the enormous face forty years it had taken him to learnwhat kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache o cruel needlessmisunderstanding o stubborn selfwilled exile from the loving breasttwo ginscented tears trickled down the sides of his nose but it was allright everything was all right the struggle was finished he had wonthe victory over himself he loved big brotherthe endappendixthe principles of newspeaknewspeak was the official language of oceania and had been devised to meetthe ideological needs of ingsoc or english socialism in the year there was not as yet anyone who used newspeak as his sole means ofcommunication either in speech or writing the leading articles inthe times were written in it but this was a tour de force which couldonly be carried out by a specialist it was expected that newspeak wouldhave finally superseded oldspeak or standard english as we shouldcall it by about the year  meanwhile it gained ground steadily allparty members tending to use newspeak words and grammatical constructionsmore and more in their everyday speech the version in use in  andembodied in the ninth and tenth editions of the newspeak dictionary wasa provisional one and contained many superfluous words and archaicformations which were due to be suppressed later it is with the finalperfected version as embodied in the eleventh edition of the dictionarythat we are concerned herethe purpose of newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expressionfor the worldview and mental habits proper to the devotees of ingsocbut to make all other modes of thought impossible it was intended thatwhen newspeak had been adopted once and for all and oldspeak forgottena heretical thoughtthat is a thought diverging from the principles ofingsocshould be literally unthinkable at least so far as thought isdependent on words its vocabulary was so constructed as to give exact andoften very subtle expression to every meaning that a party member couldproperly wish to express while excluding all other meanings and also thepossibility of arriving at them by indirect methods this was done partlyby the invention of new words but chiefly by eliminating undesirablewords and by stripping such words as remained of unorthodox meanings andso far as possible of all secondary meanings whatever to give a singleexample the word free still existed in newspeak but it could only beused in such statements as this dog is free from lice or this field isfree from weeds it could not be used in its old sense of politicallyfree or intellectually free since political and intellectual freedom nolonger existed even as concepts and were therefore of necessity namelessquite apart from the suppression of definitely heretical words reductionof vocabulary was regarded as an end in itself and no word that could bedispensed with was allowed to survive newspeak was designed not to extendbut to diminish the range of thought and this purpose was indirectlyassisted by cutting the choice of words down to a minimumnewspeak was founded on the english language as we now know it thoughmany newspeak sentences even when not containing newlycreated wordswould be barely intelligible to an englishspeaker of our own day newspeakwords were divided into three distinct classes known as the a vocabularythe b vocabulary also called compound words and the c vocabularyit will be simpler to discuss each class separately but the grammaticalpeculiarities of the language can be dealt with in the section devoted tothe a vocabulary since the same rules held good for all three categoriesthe a vocabulary the a vocabulary consisted of the words needed for thebusiness of everyday lifefor such things as eating drinking workingputting on ones clothes going up and down stairs riding in vehiclesgardening cooking and the like it was composed almost entirely of wordsthat we already possess words like hit run dog tree sugar housefieldbut in comparison with the presentday english vocabulary theirnumber was extremely small while their meanings were far more rigidlydefined all ambiguities and shades of meaning had been purged out ofthem so far as it could be achieved a newspeak word of this class wassimply a staccato sound expressing one clearly understood concept itwould have been quite impossible to use the a vocabulary for literarypurposes or for political or philosophical discussion it was intendedonly to express simple purposive thoughts usually involving concreteobjects or physical actionsthe grammar of newspeak had two outstanding peculiarities the first ofthese was an almost complete interchangeability between different parts ofspeech any word in the language in principle this applied even to veryabstract words such as if or when could be used either as verb nounadjective or adverb between the verb and the noun form when they wereof the same root there was never any variation this rule of itselfinvolving the destruction of many archaic forms the word thought forexample did not exist in newspeak its place was taken by think whichdid duty for both noun and verb no etymological principle was followedhere in some cases it was the original noun that was chosen for retentionin other cases the verb even where a noun and verb of kindred meaningwere not etymologically connected one or other of them was frequentlysuppressed there was for example no such word as cut its meaning beingsufficiently covered by the nounverb knife adjectives were formed byadding the suffix ful to the nounverb and adverbs by adding wise thusfor example speedful meant rapid and speedwise meant quickly certainof our presentday adjectives such as good strong big black softwere retained but their total number was very small there was littleneed for them since almost any adjectival meaning could be arrived at byadding ful to a nounverb none of the nowexisting adverbs was retainedexcept for a very few already ending in wise the wise termination wasinvariable the word well for example was replaced by goodwisein addition any wordthis again applied in principle to every word inthe languagecould be negatived by adding the affix un or could bestrengthened by the affix plus or for still greater emphasisdoubleplus thus for example uncold meant warm while pluscold anddoublepluscold meant respectively very cold and superlatively coldit was also possible as in presentday english to modify the meaning ofalmost any word by prepositional affixes such as ante post up downetc by such methods it was found possible to bring about an enormousdiminution of vocabulary given for instance the word good there was noneed for such a word as bad since the required meaning was equallywellindeed betterexpressed by ungood all that was necessary in anycase where two words formed a natural pair of opposites was to decidewhich of them to suppress dark for example could be replaced by unlightor light by undark according to preferencethe second distinguishing mark of newspeak grammar was its regularitysubject to a few exceptions which are mentioned below all inflexionsfollowed the same rules thus in all verbs the preterite and the pastparticiple were the same and ended in ed the preterite of steal wasstealed the preterite of think was thinked and so on throughout thelanguage all such forms as swam gave brought spoke taken etc beingabolished all plurals were made by adding s or es as the case might bethe plurals of man ox life were mans oxes lifes comparison ofadjectives was invariably made by adding er est good gooder goodestirregular forms and the more most formation being suppressedthe only classes of words that were still allowed to inflect irregularlywere the pronouns the relatives the demonstrative adjectives and theauxiliary verbs all of these followed their ancient usage except thatwhom had been scrapped as unnecessary and the shall should tenses hadbeen dropped all their uses being covered by will and would there werealso certain irregularities in wordformation arising out of the need forrapid and easy speech a word which was difficult to utter or was liableto be incorrectly heard was held to be ipso facto a bad word occasionallytherefore for the sake of euphony extra letters were inserted into a wordor an archaic formation was retained but this need made itself feltchiefly in connexion with the b vocabulary why so great an importance wasattached to ease of pronunciation will be made clear later in this essaythe b vocabulary the b vocabulary consisted of words which had beendeliberately constructed for political purposes words that is to saywhich not only had in every case a political implication but were intendedto impose a desirable mental attitude upon the person using them withouta full understanding of the principles of ingsoc it was difficult to usethese words correctly in some cases they could be translated intooldspeak or even into words taken from the a vocabulary but this usuallydemanded a long paraphrase and always involved the loss of certainovertones the b words were a sort of verbal shorthand often packingwhole ranges of ideas into a few syllables and at the same time moreaccurate and forcible than ordinary languagethe b words were in all cases compound words compound words such asspeakwrite were of course to be found in the a vocabulary but these weremerely convenient abbreviations and had no special ideological colourthey consisted of two or more words or portions of words welded togetherin an easily pronounceable form the resulting amalgam was always anounverb and inflected according to the ordinary rules to take a singleexample the word goodthink meaning very roughly orthodoxy or ifone chose to regard it as a verb to think in an orthodox manner thisinflected as follows nounverb goodthink past tense and past participlegoodthinked present participle goodthinking adjective goodthinkfuladverb goodthinkwise verbal noun goodthinkerthe b words were not constructed on any etymological plan the words ofwhich they were made up could be any parts of speech and could be placedin any order and mutilated in any way which made them easy to pronouncewhile indicating their derivation in the word crimethink thoughtcrimefor instance the think came second whereas in thinkpol thought policeit came first and in the latter word police had lost its second syllablebecause of the great difficulty in securing euphony irregular formationswere commoner in the b vocabulary than in the a vocabulary for examplethe adjective forms of minitrue minipax and miniluv were respectivelyminitruthful minipeaceful and minilovely simply because truefulpaxful and loveful were slightly awkward to pronounce in principlehowever all b words could inflect and all inflected in exactly thesame waysome of the b words had highly subtilized meanings barely intelligible toanyone who had not mastered the language as a whole consider for examplesuch a typical sentence from a times leading article as oldthinkersunbellyfeel ingsoc the shortest rendering that one could make of thisin oldspeak would be those whose ideas were formed before the revolutioncannot have a full emotional understanding of the principles of englishsocialism but this is not an adequate translation to begin with inorder to grasp the full meaning of the newspeak sentence quoted aboveone would have to have a clear idea of what is meant by ingsoc and inaddition only a person thoroughly grounded in ingsoc could appreciatethe full force of the word bellyfeel which implied a blind enthusiasticacceptance difficult to imagine today or of the word oldthink which wasinextricably mixed up with the idea of wickedness and decadence but thespecial function of certain newspeak words of which oldthink was onewas not so much to express meanings as to destroy them these wordsnecessarily few in number had had their meanings extended until theycontained within themselves whole batteries of words which as they weresufficiently covered by a single comprehensive term could now be scrappedand forgotten the greatest difficulty facing the compilers of the newspeakdictionary was not to invent new words but having invented them to makesure what they meant to make sure that is to say what ranges of wordsthey cancelled by their existenceas we have already seen in the case of the word free words which hadonce borne a heretical meaning were sometimes retained for the sake ofconvenience but only with the undesirable meanings purged out of themcountless other words such as honour justice morality internationalismdemocracy science and religion had simply ceased to exist a few blanketwords covered them and in covering them abolished them all wordsgrouping themselves round the concepts of liberty and equality forinstance were contained in the single word crimethink while all wordsgrouping themselves round the concepts of objectivity and rationalismwere contained in the single word oldthink greater precision would havebeen dangerous what was required in a party member was an outlook similarto that of the ancient hebrew who knew without knowing much else thatall nations other than his own worshipped false gods he did not need toknow that these gods were called baal osiris moloch ashtaroth and thelike probably the less he knew about them the better for his orthodoxyhe knew jehovah and the commandments of jehovah he knew therefore thatall gods with other names or other attributes were false gods in somewhatthe same way the party member knew what constituted right conduct and inexceedingly vague generalized terms he knew what kinds of departure fromit were possible his sexual life for example was entirely regulated bythe two newspeak words sexcrime sexual immorality and goodsex chastitysexcrime covered all sexual misdeeds whatever it covered fornicationadultery homosexuality and other perversions and in addition normalintercourse practised for its own sake there was no need to enumeratethem separately since they were all equally culpable and in principleall punishable by death in the c vocabulary which consisted of scientificand technical words it might be necessary to give specialized names tocertain sexual aberrations but the ordinary citizen had no need of themhe knew what was meant by goodsexthat is to say normal intercoursebetween man and wife for the sole purpose of begetting children andwithout physical pleasure on the part of the woman all else was sexcrimein newspeak it was seldom possible to follow a heretical thought furtherthan the perception that it was heretical beyond that point the necessarywords were nonexistentno word in the b vocabulary was ideologically neutral a great many wereeuphemisms such words for instance as joycamp forcedlabour camp orminipax ministry of peace ie ministry of war meant almost the exactopposite of what they appeared to mean some words on the other handdisplayed a frank and contemptuous understanding of the real nature ofoceanic society an example was prolefeed meaning the rubbishyentertainment and spurious news which the party handed out to the massesother words again were ambivalent having the connotation good whenapplied to the party and bad when applied to its enemies but inaddition there were great numbers of words which at first sight appearedto be mere abbreviations and which derived their ideological colour notfrom their meaning but from their structureso far as it could be contrived everything that had or might havepolitical significance of any kind was fitted into the b vocabulary thename of every organization or body of people or doctrine or country orinstitution or public building was invariably cut down into the familiarshape that is a single easily pronounced word with the smallest numberof syllables that would preserve the original derivation in the ministryof truth for example the records department in which winston smithworked was called recdep the fiction department was called ficdep theteleprogrammes department was called teledep and so on this was notdone solely with the object of saving time even in the early decades ofthe twentieth century telescoped words and phrases had been one of thecharacteristic features of political language and it had been noticedthat the tendency to use abbreviations of this kind was most marked intotalitarian countries and totalitarian organizations examples were suchwords as nazi gestapo comintern inprecorr agitprop in the beginningthe practice had been adopted as it were instinctively but in newspeakit was used with a conscious purpose it was perceived that in thusabbreviating a name one narrowed and subtly altered its meaning bycutting out most of the associations that would otherwise cling to itthe words communist international for instance call up a compositepicture of universal human brotherhood red flags barricades karl marxand the paris commune the word comintern on the other hand suggestsmerely a tightlyknit organization and a welldefined body of doctrineit refers to something almost as easily recognized and as limited inpurpose as a chair or a table comintern is a word that can be utteredalmost without taking thought whereas communist international is a phraseover which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily in the same waythe associations called up by a word like minitrue are fewer and morecontrollable than those called up by ministry of truth this accounted notonly for the habit of abbreviating whenever possible but also for thealmost exaggerated care that was taken to make every word easilypronounceablein newspeak euphony outweighed every consideration other than exactitudeof meaning regularity of grammar was always sacrificed to it when itseemed necessary and rightly so since what was required above all forpolitical purposes was short clipped words of unmistakable meaning whichcould be uttered rapidly and which roused the minimum of echoes in thespeakers mind the words of the b vocabulary even gained in force fromthe fact that nearly all of them were very much alike almost invariablythese wordsgoodthink minipax prolefeed sexcrime joycamp ingsocbellyfeel thinkpol and countless otherswere words of two or threesyllables with the stress distributed equally between the first syllableand the last the use of them encouraged a gabbling style of speech atonce staccato and monotonous and this was exactly what was aimed at theintention was to make speech and especially speech on any subject notideologically neutral as nearly as possible independent of consciousnessfor the purposes of everyday life it was no doubt necessary or sometimesnecessary to reflect before speaking but a party member called upon tomake a political or ethical judgement should be able to spray forth thecorrect opinions as automatically as a machine gun spraying forth bulletshis training fitted him to do this the language gave him an almostfoolproof instrument and the texture of the words with their harsh soundand a certain wilful ugliness which was in accord with the spirit ofingsoc assisted the process still furtherso did the fact of having very few words to choose from relative to ourown the newspeak vocabulary was tiny and new ways of reducing it wereconstantly being devised newspeak indeed differed from most all otherlanguages in that its vocabulary grew smaller instead of larger everyyear each reduction was a gain since the smaller the area of choicethe smaller the temptation to take thought ultimately it was hoped tomake articulate speech issue from the larynx without involving the higherbrain centres at all this aim was frankly admitted in the newspeak wordduckspeak meaning to quack like a duck like various other words inthe b vocabulary duckspeak was ambivalent in meaning provided that theopinions which were quacked out were orthodox ones it implied nothing butpraise and when the times referred to one of the orators of the partyas a doubleplusgood duckspeaker it was paying a warm and valued complimentthe c vocabulary the c vocabulary was supplementary to the others andconsisted entirely of scientific and technical terms these resembled thescientific terms in use today and were constructed from the same rootsbut the usual care was taken to define them rigidly and strip them ofundesirable meanings they followed the same grammatical rules as thewords in the other two vocabularies very few of the c words had anycurrency either in everyday speech or in political speech any scientificworker or technician could find all the words he needed in the list devotedto his own speciality but he seldom had more than a smattering of thewords occurring in the other lists only a very few words were common toall lists and there was no vocabulary expressing the function of scienceas a habit of mind or a method of thought irrespective of its particularbranches there was indeed no word for science any meaning that itcould possibly bear being already sufficiently covered by the word ingsocfrom the foregoing account it will be seen that in newspeak the expressionof unorthodox opinions above a very low level was wellnigh impossibleit was of course possible to utter heresies of a very crude kind aspecies of blasphemy it would have been possible for example to saybig brother is ungood but this statement which to an orthodox ear merelyconveyed a selfevident absurdity could not have been sustained byreasoned argument because the necessary words were not available ideasinimical to ingsoc could only be entertained in a vague wordless formand could only be named in very broad terms which lumped together andcondemned whole groups of heresies without defining them in doing soone could in fact only use newspeak for unorthodox purposes byillegitimately translating some of the words back into oldspeak forexample all mans are equal was a possible newspeak sentence but onlyin the same sense in which all men are redhaired is a possible oldspeaksentence it did not contain a grammatical error but it expresseda palpable untruthie that all men are of equal size weight orstrength the concept of political equality no longer existed and thissecondary meaning had accordingly been purged out of the word equalin  when oldspeak was still the normal means of communicationthe danger theoretically existed that in using newspeak words one mightremember their original meanings in practice it was not difficult forany person well grounded in doublethink to avoid doing this but withina couple of generations even the possibility of such a lapse would havevanished a person growing up with newspeak as his sole language would nomore know that equal had once had the secondary meaning of politicallyequal or that free had once meant intellectually free than forinstance a person who had never heard of chess would be aware of thesecondary meanings attaching to queen and rook there would be manycrimes and errors which it would be beyond his power to commit simplybecause they were nameless and therefore unimaginable and it was to beforeseen that with the passage of time the distinguishing characteristicsof newspeak would become more and more pronouncedits words growingfewer and fewer their meanings more and more rigid and the chance ofputting them to improper uses always diminishingwhen oldspeak had been once and for all superseded the last link withthe past would have been severed history had already been rewrittenbut fragments of the literature of the past survived here and thereimperfectly censored and so long as one retained ones knowledge ofoldspeak it was possible to read them in the future such fragments evenif they chanced to survive would be unintelligible and untranslatableit was impossible to translate any passage of oldspeak into newspeak unlessit either referred to some technical process or some very simple everydayaction or was already orthodox goodthinkful would be the newspeakexpression in tendency in practice this meant that no book written beforeapproximately  could be translated as a whole prerevolutionaryliterature could only be subjected to ideological translationthat isalteration in sense as well as language take for example the wellknownpassage from the declaration of independencewe hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equalthat they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rightsthat among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happinessthat to secure these rights governments are instituted among menderiving their powers from the consent of the governed that wheneverany form of government becomes destructive of those ends it is the rightof the people to alter or abolish it and to institute new governmentit would have been quite impossible to render this into newspeak whilekeeping to the sense of the original the nearest one could come to doingso would be to swallow the whole passage up in the single word crimethinka full translation could only be an ideological translation wherebyjeffersons words would be changed into a panegyric on absolute governmenta good deal of the literature of the past was indeed already beingtransformed in this way considerations of prestige made it desirable topreserve the memory of certain historical figures while at the same timebringing their achievements into line with the philosophy of ingsocvarious writers such as shakespeare milton swift byron dickens andsome others were therefore in process of translation when the task hadbeen completed their original writings with all else that survived ofthe literature of the past would be destroyed these translations werea slow and difficult business and it was not expected that they wouldbe finished before the first or second decade of the twentyfirstcentury there were also large quantities of merely utilitarianliteratureindispensable technical manuals and the likethat had tobe treated in the same way it was chiefly in order to allow time forthe preliminary work of translation that the final adoption of newspeakhad been fixed for so late a date as the endproject gutenberg australia
